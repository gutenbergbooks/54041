<h2 class="main">PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The documents presented in this volume (which
covers the years 1728&ndash;59) form a comprehensive and interesting
survey of the islands and their condition&mdash;social, religious,
military, and commercial&mdash;during the middle portion of the
eighteenth century; and the writers of these are prominent in their
respective spheres of action. The appendix furnishes a valuable
description of the savage Zambals of western Luz&oacute;n, written by a
Dominican missionary among that people in 1680.</p>
<p class="par">The first document is a translation and condensation of
the <i lang="es">Manifiesta y resumen historico de la fundacion de la
venerable hermandad de la Santa Misericordia</i> (Manila, 1728), by
Juan Baptista de Uriarte. This poorly-constructed work is chiefly
valuable, not for the direct historical facts that it gives, but for
the social and economic deductions that can be made from those facts.
For instance, in spite of the great poverty prevailing among certain
classes of Manila, it is apparent that the city possessed much wealth,
else it would have been quite impossible for the brotherhood of Santa
Misericordia to carry on its beneficent work to so great an extent. The
brotherhood is founded April 16, 1594, after the model of the
brotherhood of the same name <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href=
"#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>in Lisboa, its first establishment
being in the school of Santa Potenciana. The rules of the new
organization are ordained January 14, 1597, and first printed in 1606.
The favor and protection accorded it in the beginning by Luis Perez
Dasmari&ntilde;as is continued by many succeeding governors and
ecclesiastics, many of whom act as purveyors. As might be expected, the
first attempts toward charitable aid are weak, but strength is
gradually attained, and the noble work of the brotherhood receives due
recognition. Certain pious funds are gradually established; the
brotherhood executes many wills; a hospital is early founded, under the
spiritual charge of the Franciscans. In 1597, the royal hospital is
taken in charge by the Misericordia at the request of Governor Tello,
in order that it may be managed better. Amid all the many disasters
from the time of its foundation to 1728&mdash;shipwrecks, other sea
accidents, invasions by the Dutch, earthquakes, etc.&mdash;the
brotherhood ever lends a helping hand cheerfully. The city is divided
into three parts, for the greater good of the poor and destitute. The
various amounts of the alms distributed, which are given throughout the
work, show how well the brotherhood discharged the purpose of its
foundation. Christianity is debtor to this organization through the aid
furnished to the religious orders at various times. Generous aid has
been given to the prisons, to poor widows, to orphan girls (for whom a
school is founded), and to noble destitute families, and others. Its
activities extend even to the ransoming of Spanish and Portuguese
prisoners from the Dutch; to the care of the native, Spanish, and
foreign soldiers who fight under the banners of Spain; and even to
Japan. A productive <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13"
name="pb13">13</a>]</span>rule of the brotherhood is the one compelling
all the brothers at death to leave something to the association. From
1619 on, many loans are made from the coffers of the Misericordia to
the royal treasury, which is generally in a state of exhaustion; and
these loans are always cheerfully given, even in the midst of the
depressions that the association experiences. That the brotherhood has
enemies is shown by citations from a manifesto which charges it with
neglect and poor business management. These charges are, however,
disproved by our author. Indeed, the Manila house exceeds in the amount
of its alms, those given by the Lisbon or mother house. Elections are
annual, and are made by ten members chosen by the brotherhood as a
unit. The board is composed of thirteen brothers, chief of whom is the
purveyor; his duties, as well as those of the secretary, treasurer, and
three stewards, are stated. The remaining brothers of the board are
known as deputies. Royal decrees of 1699 and 1708 exempt the
association from visitation by either ecclesiastical or civil
officials, a concession that had been long before conferred upon it by
Tello. An important event in the history of the brotherhood is the
completion in 1634 of its church and school of Santa Isabel, whereby it
does much good, especially among the orphan girls under its charge.
Confessions in the school are in charge of the Jesuits. Many of the
girls of the school enter the religious life, but others marry, and to
all such a generous dowry is provided. Regular devotions are prescribed
for the girls; and for the brothers of the association various church
duties are ordained. The girls are also required to help in the kitchen
and to learn the duties of housekeeping, so that at marriage
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>they are quite ready to assume the position of
wife. The number of girls and women aided in this school and church
reaches into the thousands, and the expenses of the church have been
considerably over 100,000 pesos. In 1656, the brotherhood makes a
transfer of its hospital to the hospital order of St. John of God.
Chief among the funds established for the use of the brotherhood are
those by Governor Manuel de Leon of 50,000 pesos, and by the famous
Archbishop Pardo of 13,000. Notwithstanding the many disasters that
have occurred in the islands, many of which affect the brotherhood, the
latter has never been in a better condition than at the time when this
manifesto is written. In his final chapter, Uriarte gives a list of the
members of the board of the brotherhood, of which he is secretary. He
also gives in full various documents which he has mentioned in the body
of his relation. Under charge of the association is the appointment of
twenty-nine chaplaincies (apparently among the religious orders, for
ten chaplaincies for lay priests are also mentioned); and a certain
number of fellowships are supported in San Jos&eacute; college. The
brotherhood is composed of 250 members, whose qualifications and duties
are given. The work ends with an account of the annual alms given by
the association.</p>
<p class="par">The condition of the islands in 1739 is well depicted in
the relation furnished in that year to the home government by Governor
Vald&eacute;s Tam&oacute;n. Brief descriptions are given of the city of
Manila, and the port of Cavite, with their fortifications, gates,
artillery, garrisons, and military supplies; the document contains
similar accounts of all the other military posts in the Philippines,
and short descriptions <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15"
name="pb15">15</a>]</span>of the various provinces in which the islands
are governed. Lack of space, however, obliges us to omit the greater
part of these accounts, presenting only those concerned with Manila,
Cavite, Ceb&uacute;, and Zamboanga.</p>
<p class="par">In 1742 an additional report was made for the king in
regard to the status of the ecclesiastical estate in the islands; this
is here given in full. The four cathedral churches are first mentioned,
with the jurisdiction, incumbent, expenses, and sources of income of
each. The other religious and the educational institutions of Manila,
and its hospitals, are enumerated, with statements of the aid given to
each by the royal treasury. A list is given of all the encomiendas in
the islands granted for such purposes, also of those granted to private
persons. Another section is devoted to the missions which are carried
on by the religious orders, and to the expenditures made for them by
the government of the islands, tabulated statements of which are given,
as in the other sections of this report. There is also a table of the
amounts collected by the religious who are in charge of the mission
villages as offerings on feast days. At the close are found some
remarks eulogistic of the friars&rsquo; labors in the islands, with an
expression of regret that they have not carried out the king&rsquo;s
orders to have the Castilian language taught to the Filipino
natives.</p>
<p class="par">The work carried on by the Misericordia was well
supplemented by that of the hospital order of St. John of God, an
account of which was published (Granada, 1742) by one of its brethren
in Manila, Juan Manuel Maldonado de Puga. He describes the urgent need
of aid for the sick there, the efforts <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>made in early years
(chiefly by the Misericordia) to supply this want, and the coming of
the hospitalers of St. John (1641) to Manila. The government places in
their charge the royal hospital at Cavite (1642), and the Misericordia
surrender to them their hospital in Manila (1656); and for a time they
conduct a hospital for convalescents at Bagumbaya. A full account is
given of the transfer of the Misericordia hospital, and of its history
up to 1740. Some difficulties arise between the hospitalers and the
Misericordia, which are decided in favor of the former by the Jesuit
university. Maldonado presents a careful description of the new church
and convent erected in 1727 by the hospitalers, and narrates the
leading events in their history. An interesting digression by our
author describes the system of weighing in use by the Sangley traders
in the islands, and the substitution therefor (1727) of the Castilian
steelyard and standards of weight; he states that he is the first to
explain the Chinese system, and we know of no other writer who has done
so. He proceeds to give an account of the manner in which the Filipinas
province of the hospital order is governed, with lists of its
provincials and of its present officers and members; and then
enumerates the incomes and contributions of the order in the islands,
relating the history of these, and similarly the grants of royal aid to
its work there. In this connection is described the personal service
called <i lang="es">reserva</i> or <i lang="es">polo</i>, which is
imposed on the natives. Another chapter enumerates and describes the
charitable foundations [<i lang="es">obras pias</i>] from which the
hospital receives aid. Maldonado describes the present condition of the
other hospitals in the islands, those outside Manila being mainly for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>special classes&mdash;the lepers, the Chinese, the
soldiers, etc.; and few of them are properly managed or served. He ends
with an apology for numerous errors in his text, due to the blunders of
native amanuenses.</p>
<p class="par">A letter from Manila (July 16, 1746) to the president of
the India Council recounts the difficulties and dangers with which the
islands are threatened by the Dutch and English, who are sending goods
from their Eastern factories to America, lying in wait to seize the
Spanish galleons, and even menacing Manila. The writer suggests that
the former trade between Luz&oacute;n and the Malabar coast be resumed,
and that more effective measures be taken to overawe the Dutch and
English in Eastern waters.</p>
<p class="par">The Jesuit Antonio Masvesi informs his brother (December
2, 1749) of the failure of the Jol&oacute; and Mindanao missions, and
severely criticises the governor, Bishop Arrechedera, for his
infatuation with the sultan of Jol&oacute;, and his lavish
entertainment of that treacherous and crafty Moro, against the advice
of the Jesuits. Masvesi sends also an account of these matters by a
brother Jesuit, these letters being intended to counteract the
influence of Arrechedera&rsquo;s reports to the home government.</p>
<p class="par">A curious memorial to the king, by an Englishman named
Norton but naturalized in Spain, urges that that country open up a
direct commerce with the Philippine Islands by way of the Cape of Good
Hope, and that mainly in cinnamon. He enumerates the products and
exports of the islands, and urges that these be cultivated more than
they are&mdash;above all, the cinnamon, which is now purchased by Spain
and her colonies from the Dutch, at exorbitant <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>prices.
The finest quality of this spice could be produced in Mindanao, and
Norton recommends that plantations of cinnamon be made there, thus
furnishing it to Spain and the colonies at a lower price, and retaining
their silver for their own use instead of allowing their enemies to get
possession of it. He recapitulates the great advantages which will
accrue to Spain, to her people and colonists, and to the Indian
natives, from the execution of this project; and he would cultivate in
the islands not only cinnamon but pepper. He cites figures from the
Amsterdam <i>Gazette</i> to show how great quantities of commodities
which might be produced by the Philippines are brought to Europe from
the Dutch factories in the East; and he points out how Spain might
profitably exchange cinnamon and pepper for the lumber, cordage, etc.,
which she now purchases for cash from Norway and Russia. He urges that
Spain should no longer submit to the tyranny of the Dutch and other
heretics, who are really in her power, since they must depend on her
for silver. He asks that the king will appoint a commission to examine
and report on his project, and enumerates various conditions which he
requires in order to establish the direct commerce between Spain and
Filipinas. At the end are stated the numerous advantages which would
accrue to Spain and the colonies from the execution of Norton&rsquo;s
plan.</p>
<p class="par">Appendix: Domingo Perez, one of the most noted of the
seventeenth century Dominican missionaries, writes an account in 1680,
from personal experience, of the newly-acquired Dominican province of
Zambales, in which he describes that province, and the people in their
manifold relations. He gives much <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19"
href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>interesting information, for the
truth of which he vouches, concerning the Malayan race of the Zambals,
whose peculiar characteristics he describes, from the standpoints of
their religion and superstitions, and their social and economic life;
describes the changes effected by the softening influences of the
Christian religion; and gives various suggestions as to their
management. They are seen to possess a religion somewhat vague in its
general concept, but quite specific and complex in its individual
points, with a graded priesthood, to all of which, however, not too
great importance must be attached. In their superstitious beliefs, they
approach quite closely to the other peoples of the Philippines. Birds
are a good or bad omen according to circumstances; sneezing is always a
bad omen; great credence is given to dreams. Marriage is an important
ceremony, and chastity is general among the women, who exercise great
power among the people. Feasts are occasions for intoxication. Above
all, they are fierce headhunters, and strive to cut off as many heads
as possible, although they are a cowardly race. The Dominican policy of
governing the Zambals is one of concentration, in which they are well
aided by the garrison of Spanish soldiers stationed in the Zambal
country.</p>

Ronquillo; and the majority of the nobility and citizens of the city.
And they having been informed of the so holy end for which this
venerable brotherhood and confraternity is instituted (in regard to
which matter, a devout talk was given by the very reverend father
rector of the college of the said Society of Jesus, Antonio
Sede&ntilde;o, who with the ardor of his spirit, informed them of the
importance that the foundation of the venerable brotherhood, whose
institution they were discussing for the spiritual and temporal welfare
of their neighbors, would be in the time of their greatest calamities
and miseries); in view of all of which, having conferred with mature
deliberation and due reflection concerning the seriousness of the
matter: they unanimously and harmoniously decided upon the foundation
of so holy a brotherhood. From that time it was considered as
established with the fixed resolution to begin the exercise of works of
charity, in accordance with the rules which were made for the better
government of the brotherhood, the original of which are conserved in
the first book of records. Then immediately their Excellencies, the
ecclesiastical and secular governors, who were present, each one for
himself, in the part that pertained to him, confirmed all the abovesaid
and affixed their signatures. It was agreed for the time being that
this venerable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>brotherhood of our Lady of Charity should be
established in the college of Santa Potenciana in this city.</p>
<p class="par">The first brothers who composed the financial board
[<i lang="es">mesa</i>] of this brotherhood, numbered thirteen: the
purveyor Don Luis Perez das Mari&ntilde;as, knight of the Order of
Alcantara, governor and captain-general of these islands; its
secretary, Don Estevan de Marquina; its treasurer, Don Juan de
Esquerra; the deputies, Don Juan Ronquillo, Don Christoval de Azqueta,
Don Antonio de Ca&ntilde;edo, Don Francisco de Poza, Don Diego del
Castillo, Don Juan de Alzega, Don Juan Arseo, Don Hernando Nu&ntilde;ez
de Pe&ntilde;alosa, Don Juan de la Lara, and Don Thomas de Machuca.
Those gentlemen in the meeting held May 11, 1594, enacted that this
venerable brotherhood should militate under the protection and favor of
that of Lisboa, since that is the head of all the brotherhoods which
are founded in the districts of Espa&ntilde;a and of India, so that
recognizing this brotherhood as its offspring, they might establish a
mutual correspondence and a perpetual brotherhood, and, as faithful
brothers aiding one another, obtain the chief end of their institute
which is directed to the exercise of works of charity and mercy. On
this matter, having written to the said venerable brotherhood, the
latter responded without the least delay, congratulating it on having
obtained in its foundation and brothers the limit of its desires, and
despatched the rules of that house which were received by this
brotherhood in 1596. And in order that they might be observed more
fittingly and performed in accordance with the condition and state of
the land, it was necessary to revise some of them, although only a few,
but only after <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>great thought and consideration by very learned
persons. Those which today are in force were ordained January 14, 1597,
in a meeting called for that effect. They were given to the press in
1606. At the same time this brotherhood succeeded in being admitted and
recognized as an offspring by the brotherhood of the Misericordia of
the city of Lisboa.</p>

<h3 class="label">CHAPTER III</h3>
<h3 class="main"><i>Of the condition and conveniences of this
brotherhood in its beginning</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Not a little admiration is caused upon beholding
the weak foundations upon which the providence of God erected so great
a work for the spiritual and temporal consolation of the poor and
wretched people, who suffered extreme necessities in this community. In
the beginning of its foundation, so scarce were the conveniences for
obtaining the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>desired fruit of its chief institution that
scarcely did they succeed in remedying the most urgent needs of their
neighbors; but, as it advanced on account of the liberal hand of God,
it commenced, as a father of charity, to scatter its gifts by means of
worthy benefactors of this house, the first who liberally ennobled and
enriched it being the said Don Luis Perez das Mari&ntilde;as, with the
following concessions and alms.</p>
<p class="par">1. The first concession which he conceded to this
brotherhood was three toneladas in the cargo of the ships which
annually voyage to the port of Acapulco in the kingdom of Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a, to bring the royal situado belonging to these islands,
the date of its bestowal being April 30, 1594. It was confirmed by Don
Francisco Tello, governor and captain-general of these islands, January
24, 1597.</p>
<p class="par">2. The second was of ten shops in the Alcayceria, the
Pari&aacute;n of the Sangleys, its date being August 29, 1595.</p>
<p class="par">3. The third was of an encomienda of eight hundred
tributes in the valley of Ytuy, in whose conquest the said Don Luis was
taking part, its date being April 25, 1596.</p>
<p class="par">4. The fourth was twenty-four young bulls which the said
gentleman applied from his Majesty&rsquo;s stockfarm as an alms for
this venerable brotherhood.</p>
<p class="par">These concessions were the principal support of this
venerable brotherhood. After them followed some other alms, which in
particular demonstration of their especial purpose were made by the
said gentleman with the certain knowledge that by so good direction
they would be distributed without the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>slightest delay and
proportionally to the need of each person.</p>
<p class="par">From that instant it appears that the providence of God
pledged itself in moving the hearts of men so that this so great work
should take its greatest increase by means of the plentiful bequests
which were left to this brotherhood, and funds which were frequently
established as an encouragement of the pious ends in which its charity
was exercised, committing their best alms and aids for the relief of
the necessities of the poor, both families and self-respecting persons,
in the best kind of bonds. The brotherhood obtained at the same time
many trusts which the faithful administration of wills gained for it,
which were in its charge, by the exact fulfilment which it gave to
them. Therefrom there resulted to this venerable brotherhood the
well-known advantages which immediately resulted to the benefit of the
said poor, whose needs and their relief were the only object of all its
attention.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="label">CHAPTER IV</h3>
<h3 class="main"><i>Of the hospital which this brotherhood founded, and
the Christian and charitable exercises in which it was
occupied.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">This venerable brotherhood imagined that it was
lukewarm and neglectful in its love toward its neighbor, so long as it
did not manifest it in works proportionate to its greatness. On that
account its charity gave the first flights in the foundation and
erection of a hospital in which poor soldiers were to be treated.
Inasmuch as there was no other in whom to place the care of this so
great need, this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>brotherhood attended promptly to so fitting a
relief, building it at the cost of many pesos in 1596, supplying what
was possible in so little time, for the erection of said hospital. In
fact, it was obtained with the happiness which its memory should make
famous three years after its foundation. It gave its first attention to
seeing that it was well provided with beds, good food, and other things
necessary for the greatest relief of the sick, and secondly, by
inquiring personally and anxiously ascertaining the lodging of said
sick soldiers, so that they might immediately conduct them to the said
hospital of Santa Misericordia.</p>
<p class="par">So Christian and punctual and careful in their material
treatment of the sick were they that this venerable brotherhood
arranged for three deputies of the financial board alternately and
continuously to live in the said hospital, for the better care and
management of the medicines, their prompt application, and the
competent assistance of physician and surgeon who treated the sick
therein, as well as the good administration and management which they
were to have of the many pesos which were spent for those pious ends;
the seraphic order of our father St. Francis [had charge] in the
spiritual of the care of their souls with exemplary zeal and love, by
means of one of its religious, a priest, who was maintained by this
brotherhood, and to whom it gave everything necessary.</p>
<p class="par">Within three years after the foundation of this
hospital, so much had the idea of the charity with which the sick were
treated, and the good management which was observed in it, increased,
that on December 3, 1597, his Excellency, Don Juan [<i>i.e.</i>,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>Francisco] Tello, governor and captain-general of
these islands, sent to this financial board (which was then at Santa
Potenciana) Doctor Don Antonio de Morga, who was an auditor of this
royal Audiencia, and his lieutenant-governor and captain-general, who
afterwards merited promotion to the royal Council of Castilla, to lay
before the purveyor and deputies of the brotherhood that it was quite
apparent to all the members of this holy confraternity that, in order
that charity might be good it had to commence by itself; and
accordingly, since this financial board and all its brothers were
exercising the works of charity and mercy with so great fervor as was
well known, and since they knew the needs that the hospital of the
Spaniards, our brothers, was suffering, not so much for lack of means
as of management, wherefore, so great a number of Spaniards died, and
the wealth and means which his Majesty has given it were not used to
advantage: we should consider it fitting to include that hospital with
ours for the slaves, as was most suitable for us, as it was of our own
nation; and to manage it in the same manner as ours of the
Misericordia, so that the wealth and means which it had should only be
spent and laid out for the benefit of the sick, and so that there might
be order, concert, and relief, in order that by this means the so many
deaths that occurred daily therein, because of the poor administration,
order, and lack of relief, might be avoided; and that if this financial
board and the holy confraternity desired to accept and to take charge
of a matter of so great service to God, our Sovereign, and of his
Majesty, as taking under our charge the management of the said hospital
by way of charity, his Lordship, the governor, would be prompt with all
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>the power that he possessed and all the means that
he could use to withdraw this board from all individual and general
risk of giving account now or at any time of the wealth and possessions
of said hospital, which his Majesty had given it, both as governor and
as patron and manager. If necessary he would transfer it and resign
that office to this board, and would cause and command that now and in
no time should they be obliged to give account of what his Majesty had
given and assigned to the said hospital for the support of the sick and
the other expenses connected with it, but that with it and all that it
should have, we should proceed in the same form and manner as with ours
of Misericordia in accordance with our rules. In regard to this, the
governor would do all that was necessary, and that his Lordship could
do, for he was assured of the great service that would be performed to
God our Lord; also that the conscience of his Majesty would be
discharged; and that great gain would come to the community and its
citizens. Thus far the proposition.</p>
<p class="par">On behalf of the board, reply was made that they would
convoke a general chapter of the brotherhood, in order to inform all
the brothers; and that they would hand in writing to the said doctor
whatever resulted in regard to this proposition, so that he might
inform the governor without any delay.</p>
<p class="par">In the general chapter of the brotherhood, which was
held December 6, 1597, it was resolved unanimously that the management
of the said hospital should be assumed by the board of the Santa
Misericordia, so that both Majesties might be served therein, provided
that the governor fulfilled the clauses and conditions which were set
forth in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>memorial on the part of the purveyor and deputies
of the brotherhood. On their presentation, the approval of them all
resulted. In accordance with and by virtue of an act and edict of the
superior government, transfer of the said hospital to the purveyor and
deputies of the Santa Misericordia became a reality, being given before
the alcalde-in-ordinary, Don Gaspar Osorio de Moya, and the royal
official judges, then Don Domingo Ortiz de Chagoya, accountant, and Don
Francisco de las Missas, factor. All the above was executed January 3,
1598, and the board of the Santa Misericordia remained in possession of
the said hospital as will appear more at length from the papers formed
on this point.</p>
<p class="par">This proposition in all its circumstances well shows the
credit which this venerable brotherhood had negotiated and gained, not
only in the estimation of the holy religious orders and the citizens of
this city, but also in the appreciation of the governor, Don Francisco
Tello, who transferred the royal hospital of the Spaniards with so
great satisfaction and confidence to the care and management of this
board; for his Lordship believed that by this measure, he was securing
and founding a new estate of relief, assistance, and aid for the sick
Spaniards of the said hospital, because of the kindness and good
management of so zealous and Christian brothers.</p>

<h3 class="main"><i>Of the disasters which assaulted Manila during the
five years from 599 to 604; and how the charity of the brothers of
Santa Misericordia shone forth to the good of their neighbor.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">[The years 1599 and the first four of the
seventeenth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>century prove very disastrous for the Philippines,
for they are visited by many earthquakes, and suffer many other losses
and misfortunes. The first earthquake of June 21, 1599, does much
damage to buildings, and it is followed by other disastrous earthquakes
in 1600. This year also are lost the two ships &ldquo;Santa
Margarita,&rdquo; in the Ladrones, and &ldquo;San Geronimo,&rdquo; in
Catanduanes; and the raid of Oliver van Noordt occurs. In 1601, two
galleons are lost in a hurricane&mdash;&ldquo;Santo Thomas&rdquo; in
Camarines on its way from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and the second in the
shipyard of Pa&ntilde;amao near Leyte. Two ships from Acapulco land at
the islands in 1602 with goods wasted and rotten. In 1603, a fire
causes the loss of more than one million pesos in goods; and the
disastrous rising of the Chinese also occurs.]</p>
<p class="par">This is a brief sketch of what happened during the five
years in this city of Manila&mdash;events which truly cannot be read
without great horror. During that time the extreme necessity of many
poor people was crying out for relief, especially that of many women,
who were coming from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and wretched slaves who
because of the rigor of unsatisfied hunger were yielding up their
lives. A good proof of this truth is a letter (the original of which
this brotherhood preserves) from his Excellency, Don Diego Bazquez de
Mercado, most worthy archbishop of the holy cathedral church of this
city, who was promoted from bishop of Campeche to this church, where he
had before been its dean, and had been at the foundation of this
venerable brotherhood as the ecclesiastical governor of the vacant see
of Don Fray Domingo de Salazar. Its date is August 15, 613, and it was
written in duplicate to our most holy father, Paul Fifth, and is of the
following tenor. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">[In this letter Vazquez de Mercado informs the pope of
the growth of Christianity in the Philippines, much of which he
attributes, in addition to the work of the religious orders, to the
work of the Santa Misericordia. He asks the pope to confirm the
enclosed rules and regulations of the brotherhood. He also asks for
certain indulgences in order that the rules may be followed
properly.]</p>
<p class="par">During this time of the most cruel miseries and
disasters this venerable brotherhood made a rare show of the greatest
strength of its burning charity, for it appears that, through this
house of the Misericordia, God erected a new storehouse, well provided
with every remedy for the consolation of invalids, the relief of
prisoners, and the remedy of the sick. Thus the Misericordia attended
promptly to what it considered most fitting, striving as much as
possible to soften the lamentations and tears of so many poor people
who begged relief in troops for their extreme need, by distributing
among them daily, and when the cords of hunger pressed them more
tightly, in the public places of this city vast alms, which exceeded
three hundred pesos weekly. At the same time it took the most vigorous
measures for the construction of new infirmaries or rooms, which were
erected after the hospital of the Misericordia, in order to attend
nearer at hand, and with greater and prompter assistance, the pains,
treatment, and relief of so many poor women who refused to receive them
anywhere else, as well as to the wretched slaves who were dying of
hunger or sickness in the out-of-the-way places of this city. If this
so Christian provision had been lacking those people could not have
obtained spiritual or temporal consolation. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">With so powerful and Christian an example, this holy
brotherhood moved and attracted all the city, not only to the imitation
of so devout exercises but also succeeded in getting the free
co&ouml;peration of many alms which were distributed for so pious
purposes. All of the city was divided into three equal parts or wards,
so that the deputies of the board, who were successively occupied in
this, might distribute said alms, and many others which were given into
their own hands in proportion to the necessity and rank of each one of
the families. In this it was quite evident that the liberal hand of God
was working in order to succor with so great piety so innumerable
miseries. It appears that during the hard times of those five years,
this brotherhood distributed more than 80,000 pesos to the benefit of
all this community and its poor.</p>
<p class="par">This brotherhood seeing that for the fulfilment of its
principal rule of relieving the necessities of its neighbor spiritually
and physically, the brothers who composed the board [<i lang=
"es">mesa</i>] were not sufficient, thought it advisable to provide
that, up to the number of forty, they should busy themselves in
attending promptly to the greatest necessity that called to them, in
order to furnish the most efficacious relief; that it would be well to
take charge of the poor sick men and women, and bring them to the
hospitals; that it would be well to gather the dead bodies and bury
them; that it would be well for the assistance in hospitals and
treatment of the sick, to watch and find in all the suburbs and wards
of this city, the persons who needed physician, surgeon, and medicines.
And upon the instant they gave advice to the treasurer and almsgivers
appointed by the board, so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href=
"#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>that they might attend to the most
important remedy.</p>
<p class="par">One cannot imagine the work of this venerable
brotherhood during the time of those disasters in attending to and
providing for all the necessities in the two hospitals of the Spaniards
and of the native soldiers of the country; to the two infirmaries of
poor women, and of wretched slaves; and to the two prisons of the court
and the city, which were also dependent upon the assistance and relief
which their charity negotiated for them: since it is certain that
besides the personal work of the brothers, in those first years, for
the above purposes alone, and for other pious ends, there was spent
from the year 599 to that of 650 a sum of more than 540,446 pesos, 7
tomins, which it has been possible to verify in the short time that I
have had for it, and other liquidations that will be set forth
hereafter. But this was done with such accounts and checks on the parts
of treasurer and almsgivers of this house that a strict monthly or
annual residencia was taken from them by the purveyor and other
deputies, the balances resulting either against or in favor punctually.
Their revision was entrusted to the purveyor and secretary of the board
and immediately they proceeded to the satisfaction of the said balances
of all parties.</p>

increase and conservation of the Catholic faith, both <span class=

given to the religious orders that they might pursue their work,
especially between the years 1600&ndash;1650, such alms being used for
edifices of worship and other pious purposes. The prisons have been a
special object of care to the brotherhood, for the prisoners of the two
prisons in Manila have been looked after daily in regard to clothing
and other matters; and an attorney has been paid to conduct their
cases, in order that they might be concluded at the earliest possible
moment. For this more than one thousand pesos has been spent annually.
Alms have been given to widows to the amount of four, eight, twelve,
sixteen, twenty, and twenty-four reals weekly; and the same is true of
poor soldiers disabled in the royal service in the Philippines and
vicinity, to whom alms are distributed weekly. The noble families who
have been overtaken by adversity have also been aided, and that so
tactfully that the asking of alms by them has cost no embarrassment. To
them the weekly distribution has amounted to twenty, thirty, fifty, one
hundred and more pesos. The brotherhood has always been careful to
inquire into the morals of those among whom its alms have been
distributed, and evil morals have meant suspension from the alms-list,
to which they have been readmitted on reforming. Brothers of the
confraternity found to be leading an evil life have been expelled from
membership until they have given assurances of reform. Especial care
has been taken in relieving members who have fallen into misfortunes.
Orphan girls whose fathers have died in the royal service in the wars
have been sheltered, taught, supported, and, at marriage, given a
dowry. From the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=

than three thousand orphan girls have been so aided.]</p>

mentioned in chapter ii, for its better management and government,
various chapters of rules were formed. One of them was that all the
brothers in the wills that they signed were obliged to leave some alms
to the brotherhood. With such a beginning which gave prestige to the
works of this house, the brothers tried to have their wills ready
before they started for the undertakings or conquests that were
undertaken during that period. Hence resulted the foundations of
various works, whose capitals were invested in annuities with most
secure bonds and from their rent a great part of the alms which this
house distributes, thus giving fulfilment to their pious purposes.
Besides this, they also ordered in their wills other sums to be
distributed at the discretion of the board, and they were applied as a
relief for the necessities of the poor, for this brotherhood in the
administration of the many works under its charge has not pretended to
extract <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>other fruit than that of serving God by relieving
and succoring the miseries and hardships of its neighbor, exercising
itself continually in the fulfilment of works of charity.</p>
<p class="par">From the first years of foundation until that of 1650,
it appears that in the pious assignment of alms for the missions of
Japon, in masses which have been said by the sacred orders, in the
church of the Santa Misericordia, in alms for the religious
communities, in repairs of their convents, in relief for poor widows,
in dowries for the girls of the schools and other poor girls of the
community, in their food and clothing, and in other things, this
venerable brotherhood has distributed and spent 107,125 pesos, 4
tomins, 3 granos, which have been earned and produced by the capitals
of the funds invested at interest. I surely believe that this house is
one of the precious stones which most beautify the crown of the king,
our sovereign. But, in every way, the paragraph which follows is of
more value.</p>
<p class="par">In these times and, those extending to the year 660, in
which the sums of pesos which entered into this house were very great,
due to the liberality of illustrious benefactors (among the least not
being those assigned by the governors of these islands, Don Luis Perez
das Mari&ntilde;as, Don Francisco Tello, Don Juan de Silva, Don
Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera, and Don Sabiniano Manrrique de Lara),
the sum of 356,363 pesos, 3 tomins, which the book of the treasurer for
those years gives as data, was reached. In that time there were many
wills which were fulfilled by this venerable brotherhood; and there
were not few bequests and alms which were given to it, especially by
the will of the alguacil-mayor, Don Bartholome Thenorio, who left
special memories in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43"
name="pb43">43</a>]</span>this house, the last being a principal of
twenty thousand pesos which still remain while the interest therefrom
from the year 702 until the present time is more than twenty-five
thousand.</p>

<h3 class="label">CHAPTER IX</h3>
<h3 class="main"><i>In which are shown in separate items the
supplements of reals which the house of Santa Misericordia has given to
the royal treasury of this city, during the periods of its greatest
poverty and necessity, occasioned both by the raids which have been
made in these islands by the Dutch enemy and for re&euml;nforcements
and fortifications of this royal camp and of other presidios of the
royal crown from the year 619 until that of 726 for the service of his
Majesty (whom may God preserve for many years).</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">[The royal treasury reaches a state of exhaustion
in 1619 because of the inroads of the Dutch, who harry the Spanish
presidios and forts. In this year Governor Alonso Faxardo is compelled
to ask a loan of the brotherhood, for which he offers good security.
That loan is unanimously voted by the purveyor and deputies, on April
4, 1619, and amounts to 39,599 pesos, 5 tomins.]</p>
<p class="par">October 6, 638, it also appears from a certification of
the royal officials that they gave to the royal treasury by way of loan
104,609 pesos, 2 tomins, 1 grano, while Don Sebastian Hurtado de
Corcuera was governor and captain-general of these islands, as a relief
for the necessity therein, and the prosecution of the conquest of Jolo
and the supplies of war which would be required for its total
conclusion.</p>
<p class="par">It also appears by another certificate that on July
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>3, 643, the purveyor and deputies of the
Misericordia paid 57,468 pesos, 2 tomins by way of a loan, by virtue of
an order of the said governor, to attend to the necessities of the
treasury. And inasmuch as in the said year, because of his Lordship
having before received a royal decree under date of June 28 of the year
635, he wrote to this board a letter [January 28, 1643]<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e595src" href="#xd24e595" name="xd24e595src">2</a>
which is conserved in the original with many others of all
appreciation, we believe it advisable to give it here, its tenor being
as follows:</p>
<p class="par">[In this letter Corcuera cites the royal decree above
mentioned which orders general prayers said in all the churches of the
islands for the success of Spanish arms. The governor has written to
all the bishops and to the provincials of the religious orders asking
the command to be observed in their churches. He asks the Misericordia
to have a mass said in its church every Friday for the perpetual memory
of the passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, so that the Spanish
pretensions may prevail.]</p>
<p class="par">It also appears that in the year 643, forty-five
thousand pesos which came as part of the register from Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a, belonging to the property of the said Don Bartholome
Thenorio, were embargoed in the royal treasury at the petition of
Do&ntilde;a Ana de Zarate, his sister-in-law, and although the members
of the royal Audiencia declared the said sum as free and its delivery
due to the board of the Santa Misericordia, as it was his executor, yet
by certain results which the fiscal of his Majesty made, it remained in
the said royal treasury until its liquidation, and lastly, by way of
loan until the year 705, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href=
"#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>in which the final balance of the
said sum was paid from the royal treasury, in order to fulfil the will
of the said deceased.</p>
<p class="par">It likewise appears by the reports and certifications of
the royal officials, that from the year 643 and upward, there were paid
into the royal treasury by order of Governors Don Sebastian Hurtado de
Corcuera and Don Diego Faxardo, 76,231 pesos 4 tomins, from the board
of Santa Misericordia by way of loan. And although his Majesty (whom
may God preserve) was pleased to order (by virtue of the
representations given by the board) through his royal decree of March
8, 660, his Excellency, the viceroy of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, to pay the
said sum given to the royal treasury in six payments of 12,305 pesos, 2
tomins, it was impossible to collect the said sum in these islands; for
although the remissions of the said payments were made by his said
Excellency as an item in the register for the satisfaction which was to
be given to the board of Santa Misericordia, they were retained in the
royal treasury of this city from the year 663 until that of 666 in
order to succor the necessity of the city, during a period of so many
disasters. Consequently, this new loan amounted to 61,526 pesos, 2
tomins, and both together amounted to 137,757 pesos, 6 tomins, which
were employed in matters of the royal service and the benefit of these
islands.</p>
<p class="par">It also appears by another certification, that in the
year 650, 13,740 pesos were embargoed in the royal treasury which had
come consigned as a part of the register to the board of Santa
Misericordia, belonging to the property of the alguacil-mayor, Don
Bartholome Thenorio, by virtue of an order from Don <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>Diego
Faxardo, on an occasion when the royal treasury was suffering so great
necessity.</p>
<p class="par">It also appears from another certification, and royal
provision despatched by the said governor, which was announced for this
board March 1, 653, in which his Lordship represents the great need of
the treasury of his Majesty with the lack of re&euml;nforcements from
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a; that although exact efforts had been made, on
account of the general poverty which all the citizens of this city, as
was well known, were suffering, it had been impossible to remedy, not
even to the extent that was necessary, so that it might endure so
serious a lack; and that because it was very fitting for the service of
his Majesty to seek all the possible means which might exist, so that
the said royal treasury should have money with which to succor the
infantry of this royal army, until our sovereign should deign to bring
the royal situado of these islands; for the present he ordained etc.:
in consequence of which the board of the Misericordia paid 70,601
pesos, 4 tomins to the said royal treasury, with which sum it remedied
for the time being its present necessity.</p>
<p class="par">Lastly, it is well known that in the year 726, his
Excellency, Don Thoribio Joseph Miguel de Cosio y Campa, knight of the
Order of Calatrava, and governor and captain-general of these islands,
and president of the royal Chancilleria of them, finding himself in
great necessity of means to succor the need of the royal treasury on
the occasion of the loss of the galleon &ldquo;Santo Christo de
Burgos,&rdquo; with the profits of this trade, on the coast of the
island of Ticao, on account of a storm which forced it to beach on the
night of July 23 of the said year; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>upon his Lordship, the
Marquis, seeing himself forced to take most prompt measures for the
cutting of timber for the new ship which was built in the royal
shipyard of the port of Cavite, for the supplies of the royal army of
this camp, and for many other inexcusable expenses, notwithstanding
that the commerce of these islands was weak and its citizens in a time
of the greatest necessity,&mdash;because of various supplies and gifts
made to his Majesty in order to succor the need of the said royal
treasury: nevertheless, the said marquis was obliged to solicit by
other means the things necessary for the fulfilment of the royal
service, and universal welfare of these islands, by having recourse to
the house of Santa Misericordia in order to obtain forty thousand
pesos, which were supplied without prejudice to the regular works of
the house, and were made from some deposits which could be detained in
their treasury until the arrival of the royal situado which was
expected from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. He offered to pay them promptly
under the royal word; by virtue of which, and the Christian efforts
which preceded from one and the other parties, the said board supplied
33,641 pesos, 7 tomins, to the royal treasury, so that it might in part
be freed from its greatest necessity. As soon as the royal situado of
his Majesty had safely arrived at these islands his Lordship, the
marquis, kept the word which he had promised by giving entire
satisfaction to the board of the Santa Misericordia, in the full
delivery of the said sum.</p>
<p class="par">As a conclusion of all the loans made to his Majesty by
the house of Santa Misericordia will serve that which it made in the
year 646 to the royal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48"
name="pb48">48</a>]</span>treasury of these islands, when its governor
and captain-general was Don Diego Faxardo, on the occasion when they
were rumored to be surrounded by necessities and when the Dutch enemy
was at the entrances of Marivelez, as he showed in a letter which he
wrote the said board on September 12, 646, which is of the following
tenor.</p>
<p class="par">[In this letter Diego Faxardo thanks the brotherhood for
the loan of ten thousand odd pesos which it made to the royal treasury
on this occasion. All the loans between the years 1619&ndash;1726 have
amounted to 2,449,418 pesos, 2 tomins, 1 grano. In addition, the Santa
Misericordia has paid into the royal treasury between 1629&ndash;1695,
as executor for deceased persons, 14,777 pesos, 2 tomins, 3
granos.]</p>

<h3 class="main"><i>In which is given public satisfaction in behalf of
this brotherhood for a chapter of a manifesto which has been published
denouncing the rectitude and faithful administration of the brothers;
and it is proved that the annuities of the house of the Misericordia
not only are not lost, as is supposed, but that, on the contrary, they
are in much better condition than at any other time.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">[A manifesto published against the brotherhood
charges lack of business ability and neglect in the handling of its
funds, so that much of the money entrusted to it has been lost; and
proposes that the brotherhood be made subject to inspection by the
authorities&mdash;by the ecclesiastical ordinary, if the association be
considered a pious body, or by the ordinary with a royal minister, if
the association be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49"
name="pb49">49</a>]</span>regarded as under royal protection.
Discussing the manifesto our author shows that the affairs of the
brotherhood have never been more prosperous. As compared with the
religious orders, their capitals and the returns therefrom show better
results, and not nearly so many arrears. The brothers are good managers
and look after their business carefully. Those who have been benefited
by the brotherhood are so numerous that there are but few in the
community who have not been helped. From the year 1677 when the first
fund was established, the brotherhood has distributed 657,383 pesos, 6
tomins, 6 granos. The purposes for which this sum has been applied are
for masses for souls in purgatory, alms for the religious orders and
royal colleges, dowries to poor girls, alms to widows, prisoners, and
confraternities and their processions, aid to the sick, and for divine
worship, the support and clothing of its collegiate daughters, support
for women in retreat, and aid for the buildings of their house and
chaplaincies, etc. The complaints against the brotherhood have emanated
from those who have not obtained all the aid that they desired because
their credit is not sufficiently good. If the brotherhood attempt to
please everyone they will end by pleasing no one. No partiality is
shown, but affairs are managed in a businesslike manner. Even were the
brotherhood subject to inspection, it could act with no greater
rectitude.]</p>

order observed by the house of the Santa Misericordia</i></h3>
<p><i><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=

<i>in the administration of the funds under its charge, and the
dependencies annexed to them. The alms which it gives regularly from
one year to another, when there are no shipwrecks, and the account
which is given annually in it.</i></div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">I do not believe that any of the many houses of
the Misericordia throughout Christendom, can be declared to be governed
with better rules or have better accounts than that of this city of
Manila. I am not speaking without sufficient foundation, since I have
read with special attention the great order which rules in the house of
the capital of Lisboa. That house is the mother and pattern and source
of them all, to whose teaching this faithful daughter of hers, not only
has not kept its great talents which I expect from her zealous care,
idle, but also has been able ingeniously to exceed her in the pious
indulgences of increasing and treasuring up more copious annual
re&euml;nforcements for the relief of the needs of her neighbor.</p>
<p class="par">1 am very certain that this truth would run no danger
amid the extensive shoals of self-love, for it navigates governed by
the demonstrable reality which removes all kind of doubt; it is current
knowledge that the alms which are annually distributed by the royal
house of Santa Misericordia of Lisboa amount to forty thousand pesos
more or less; but it is not less well-known and certain that those
distributed by this house of Manila, when no shipwreck happens, or
other misfortunes, amount on the average to seventy thousand pesos
annually, making one mass of the benefit which the funds of the sea
yield, in addition to those which are produced by those which are
founded in bonds, possessions, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51"
href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>monopoly, encomienda of his
Majesty, chaplaincies of which he is patron, and other sources of
wealth which are added to the huge mass of the said sum. This truth is
so well known to all this city that it need no further support than the
same certainty in which it is founded.</p>
<p class="par">The order with which this house of Santa Misericordia is
governed is that on November 21, the day of the presentation of our
Lady, the Virgin Mary, and the day on which the brothers who have
formed the board for that year, and which begins the election of other
new members, the election is made by ten electors, whom all the
brotherhood appoint, in the manner provided by our rules. They number
in all thirteen brothers, the first being the new purveyor. [Next are
the] secretary and the treasurer, the latter being the one who was
secretary the previous year, who remains in that office in order to
give account of the dependencies and affairs of the house since he has
handled them all most intimately. After the above are the majordomo of
the chapel, the general manager of the house, and all annexed to it;
majordomo of prisoners; steward of the dish in which the alms are
collected; while the rest of the brothers are occupied in other
important duties of the house, such as visits of the treasury and of
the prisons, the distributions of alms, secret investigations which are
committed to them by the board, and others of like tenor.</p>
<p class="par">So great is the authority and power of the purveyor of
the house over all the brothers of the Santa Misericordia, and so
prompt the obedience of the brothers, that it rather seems a
well-ordered community of religious than of seculars, for the first
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>thing which they swear on the holy gospels when
they join the brotherhood is to well and faithfully observe the rules
of the brotherhood, and that whenever they are summoned by the purveyor
and councilors of the board, and should hear the signal of the bells,
they will go thither promptly, if there is no legitimate hindrance that
they can see. The purveyor may, when in the board, command, agree,
vote, talk, and keep silence, whenever he pleases. He can command a
board meeting called, and a general meeting of the brotherhood at the
advice of the deputies, appointing the day which he considers best. He
may transfer the board and apportion among the brothers of it the
duties of collector of alms, and visitors of the prisons. He may remove
the chaplains if they commit any notable error in his presence, as well
as the servants of the board, and the rectress or portress of the
college when he thinks best. He may proceed to the correction and
fitting punishment of the collegiates by means of the rectress when
they deserve it, and he may (which is more than all the rest) remove
with the advice of the councilors of the board those brothers who are
disobedient and break the rules of the brotherhood. He may remove those
who violate their privileges and those who live after a scandalous
manner, if having been warned three times they do not turn over a new
leaf. He may appoint others in their place, so that they may serve God
our Lord in this His house. Finally, he may (although I do not) do many
other things which limit of space does not permit me to write here.</p>
<p class="par">The seven deputies who are named above with determined
duties shall receive from their predecessors <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>the
books of which each one of them has had charge, in order to enter
therein the new accounts of debit and credit of all that which shall be
given into their power in the course of the year, and all that shall be
disbursed in order to fulfil the pious ends which are entrusted to
them. This having been inferred, I say that the first thing which is
asked by the new board from the new purveyors is to take charge of the
girls&rsquo; school, which is managed according to past custom with
allowances and expenses which are occasioned with it in the food and
clothing of all the girls, the salaries of the rectress and portress,
and other servants who are employed in it. And having accepted this
duty, he goes ahead to arrange the provisions of rice, oil, and sugar,
and other substances increased in times of the greatest cheapness and
advantage; for whose constancy in the new account which is opened in
the book of expenses of the purveyors, he sets down monthly the expense
which is made in each one of them, and in this way he proceeds in all
those of the year, placing each item down separately and procuring that
the expenses shall not be increased unless there be a greater number of
girls or wards, and, at the end of the year, he presents the book with
his account. Its examination and review is entrusted to the present
secretary, who balances it, either in favor or against, and having set
forth the balanced part, the said secretary places his approval at the
bottom of it and signs it, and enters it in the minutes of that day so
that it may stand forth for all time.</p>
<p class="par">The secretary of the board on whom devolves the greater
part of the work has his new record book in which are entered all the
despatches of the petitions <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href=
"#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>which are presented, the
distributions which are made, and the applications of the alms, both of
dowry for the schoolgirls, and the orphan girls outside [the school],
the salaries which are paid to the chaplains of the house, the portress
and the servants of the house, and the alms of the masses of Alva, 9
and 11, which are said in our church on all feast-days. Especially with
great care does he enter the two inspections or general balances, which
are struck at the beginning and end of each board, of all the sums of
pesos, both of current funds, of dowries and alms, and of deposits
which are contained in the treasury under separate headings, in order
to apply them to the purposes which their founders assigned by full
directions. He affixes his rubric to the memoranda which are in the
sacks, with the statement of what each one contains, with the day,
month, and year of the record in which they are set down. The writing
of all the above with his own hand is an operation so indispensable to
his obligation that he is obliged to do it under oath. In case of his
absence, the same is done by the treasurer who supplies his absences by
writing in a separate book whatever occurs in regard to the business
matters of the house. And as soon as the secretary takes charge of the
current despatch of the house, he is obliged to transfer to his book
whatever shall have been decreed during his absence, so that by such a
proceeding all that which belongs to the record of that year may be
found in one volume. He is also obliged to enter all the sums of pesos
which are received in the treasury in the books prepared for them, both
of the dues collected and the usufruct which are yielded by the sea
funds, besides the great number of very troublesome collections,
although the love of God makes them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55"
href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>mild and easy, to whomever works
for the welfare of his neighbor and the preservation of this house.</p>
<p class="par">He is also obliged to adjust the appointments of the
chaplains of the many chaplaincies of which the board of the Santa
Misericordia is patron, by virtue of which, and of those presented as
said chaplains, a collation of the chaplaincies has always been given
to them so far as it concerns them, and the fitting support has been
decreed and given as a relief for their poverty. In this there is no
other consideration, either in this court or in other superior courts,
but it is passed upon before the said secretary just as in the house of
Lisboa, which has as a special privilege that the secretaries of the
said house may give attestations in all and any court.</p>
<p class="par">The treasurer, who has charge of the possessions of the
Pari&aacute;n of the Sangleys, attends to the collection of their
rents, and the distribution of the alms, which are distributed every
Saturday throughout the year to the self-respecting poor at the door of
the house of the Santa Misericordia; and also the alms in pesos for the
masses which are said throughout all the months of the year by one of
the chaplains of the house for the soul of the founder, who endowed it
with the said possessions. And in the book which is delivered to him
with the enumeration and individual account of the places and location
of said possessions and of the purposes for so charitable a foundation,
the said treasurer enters the debit and credit account of all the sums
which are received monthly and are disbursed by them, collecting
receipts of them all for the account which must be given at the end of
the year, which passes in review and must be balanced like the other
accounts.</p>
<p class="par">The treasurer is also the one who is present at the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>time of the two inspections or general balances of
the treasurer. If between the last of the board which has just ended
and the new one which is formed for its government there is any
difference because of some quantity of pesos having been drawn in the
interim, for any purpose for which it has fallen due, he gives prompt
account thereof by the vouchers made and that appear from the preceding
record book and by his receipts. In this way he continues until the
conclusion of the said general review, which is generally the first
thing. Following, other important points are begun by the new board
without any confusion arising.</p>
<p class="par">The chapel steward receives in inventory all that
belongs to the church and its sacristy, with the aid of the
chaplain-in-chief of the house, from the acting secretary of the board,
and the past steward. In his presence, the list is formed item by item
in the book of inventories, and is received by the acting steward, and
when it is completed to the satisfaction of all, the four sign it, and
it is placed in the first record so that it may stand forever. He has
also another separate book of the new expenses, which are made in the
church, sacristy, and other things in his charge in the course of the
year. In it he forms the debit and credit account in minute detail, and
at the end of the year he presents the book; proceeding to his
resolution with the same solemnity as the others whom we have
mentioned.</p>
<p class="par">The attorney-general who attends to all the business and
interests of the house (except those of the annuities which have a
separate attorney with a paid advocate) receives in the book of suits
all those which the preceding board left pending, and also <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>the
writs and other papers which are to be in his charge for that year. For
the better direction, management, and outcome of said suits, an
intelligent advocate is appointed for him to whom he may apply in all
his doubts. And in all that which he does in pursuance of this order,
he gives account in all the board meetings which are regularly held
semi-weekly. A secretary, who keeps the keys of the archives, is
obliged to give him all the documents that he asks for, and shall keep
a record of the withdrawal of such.</p>
<p class="par">He also has another book, in which he enters in
alphabetical order the accounts of the funds, the costs belonging to
each one, which are caused in prosecution of the said suits, the
signature of writs and the cancellations [<i lang=
"es">chancelaciones</i>] of them<span class="corr" id="xd24e687" title=
"Not in source">.</span> Later he forms from them the general debit and
credit account in which he places the salaries of advocate, procurator,
and attorney in the royal Audiencia with the other expenses which
belong to the said matters. At the end of the year, he presents it, and
with it the fitting obligation of review, balances, and approval is
made, as in all those above mentioned. But independently of this, he
shows the book of current suits, writs, and other papers. Having been
compared by the secretary, with the statement of those which were given
to him at the beginning of the year, and of those which were given to
him from the archives in his term, if the whole thing agrees, he is
absolved from his charge, but in no other manner until the total
fulfilment.</p>
<p class="par">The steward of prisoners has in charge the collections
of the possession of the sites of the paddy-fields, whose usufruct is
distributed half and half in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58"
href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>two prisons of the court, and of
the city, for the support of the poor prisoners, and the other half in
the hospital of the Misericordia, which is in charge of the religious
of St. John of God, as a relief for sick men and women. Besides this
relief, which is monthly, they share other large alms which are
furnished from other funds administered by the house of the
Misericordia. In his book of the said possessions, with the statement
of their purposes, he forms his account of debit and credit, and, at
the time of its presentation, gives his discharge by the receipts which
he collects from the wardens of said prisons. That is generally, or
always, executed with the knowledge of the minister who has charge of
the inspection of the prisons and the relief of the needs experienced
therein.</p>
<p class="par">The steward of the dish in which the alms are collected
is obliged to send it every fortnight to two brothers of this venerable
brotherhood, so that on Sunday they may go out to collect alms in all
the public parts of this city. They having observed this measure,
return the dish and the alms to the said steward. The latter, observing
the same rule throughout the months of the year, draws up his debit and
credit account. The alms which he declares before the board are equal
in sum to those which have been collected, according as it appears. In
that conformity it is approved, the same measures as before with the
others having preceded.</p>
<p class="par">This is the government, order, and method which the
house of the Santa Misericordia has maintained faithfully, with the
punctual assistance and encouragement of the zealous, disinterested
Christians. They are the work of its brothers, whose powerful example
in the faithful administration of the funds <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>entrusted to them has enabled them to obtain
exemption from inspection of their house until the present time. They
are today more assured than ever by dint of royal decrees, the first
dated Madrid, September 7, 1699; in which his Majesty resolves and
declares that this brotherhood, in order that it may be maintained and
continue its exercises with more encouragement, shall not be subject to
visits by the ordinaries, archbishops, provisors in vacant see, or by
any other ecclesiastical minister; and that it shall be allowed to make
use as hitherto of its good government and to observe its rules and
ordinances. And in the same vein is another decree given in Buen
Retiro, under date of June 11, 1708, in which his Majesty also resolves
that the decree above inserted be kept, fulfilled, and executed,
exactly according to the terms expressed therein, and that no
embarrassment or obstacle be opposed or permitted to be opposed to the
fulfilment of its contents, as such is his royal will. In that one can
see clearly how, having been well informed, his Majesty approves the
good government of this house and the practice of its rules and
ordinances. This is the greatest intent of this chapter, and we leave
the rest so that the parties may discuss it in or out of court.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It was the year 634, in which the brotherhood of
the Santa Misericordia saw their desires fulfilled in the conclusion of
the costly building of the church and school of Santa Isabel, for the
commodious <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=

maintaining in the school of Santa Potenciana and other private houses
of shelter, at the expense of many pesos which it expended for the
pious ends of their clothing, dowries, and other like things; when the
removal of them all to the new school was arranged with especial joy
and gladness of all this city.</p>
<p class="par">[The opening of the school is marked by great
ceremonies, the chief event being the procession which is participated
in by the brotherhood and the girls of the school under the leadership
of the rectress, Cathalina de Aguirre. At the new church various
exercises are held.]</p>
<p class="par">The girls of this school have always been orphan girls,
for the most part daughters of parents of rank and of many merits and
services to the king our sovereign, who in the first days lost their
lives in the service of his Majesty. They continually praise God with
the general example to this city begging his Majesty for the greater
conservation of the Spanish monarchy and that of these islands and
their fields of Christendom. They often frequent the holy sacraments,
the holy Society of Jesus having precedence in the task of confessing
them. They spend four hours in the choir by day and night, and are
occupied in hearing mass and reciting their devotions. They are
employed by day in the work of sewing and helping in the kitchen, for
which purpose two of them are chosen weekly, both so that the food may
be cooked with neatness and so that they may learn how to take care of
and manage a house. They are under the charge of a rectress, and the
rectresses have always been persons of great virtue and example. They
have a portress who takes care <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62"
href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>of the porter&rsquo;s lodge, as
well as of the actions and decorum of the said collegiate daughters
when they call them below. On Fridays during Lent they meditate and
think over the devout exercises of the <i lang="la">Via crucis</i>
inside the school. At night they recite the rosary in a chorus to the
queen of the angels and at the stroke of half-past nine, taps sound and
silence reigns. They all sleep together in one single, capacious,
decent, and neat dormitory. They eat in the refectory and have a lesson
out of spiritual books. During Lent they listen in the choir to the
sermons which are preached in the church of said school on Monday
mornings, as well as to the explanation of the Christian doctrine on
Sunday afternoons. Those who have charge of so holy a work are those of
the holy Society of Jesus, at the request of this board. Finally, since
the chapters of the rules of the said school are many and various, they
are omitted for the present, inasmuch as the limit of time does not
allow anything else.</p>
<p class="par">The brothers of this venerable brotherhood, besides the
festivities and functions which our ordinances provide, annually attend
the said church on the day of the glorious apostles St. Philip and St.
James, and the following: in the first to celebrate the feast with
greater solemnity for the health of their Majesties and the increase
and conservation of their kingdoms and domains; and in the second, to
celebrate the obsequies and honors for the deceased kings. For the
greater concurrence, authority, and luster of so royal a function, all
the sacred orders are invited and are punctually present. A catafalque
of the size demanded by such an act is erected and on it are placed the
royal insignias, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63"
name="pb63">63</a>]</span>a great quantity of wax, and the vigil mass
and response are chanted, accompanied by the best music that can be
found, in order thereby to make a rare showing of loyalty and love by
this demonstration of piety and acknowledgment, which this venerable
brotherhood has always had, and has for its kings and sovereigns.</p>

of St. John of God, of which the board of the brotherhood is patron;
the house of women sheltered by the ecclesiastical judge of this
archbishopric; the religious orders; the public prisons; destitute
widows; orphan girls; and all poor beggars. But most of all the school
of Santa Isabel is eloquent in its praises, for since 1634, the
brotherhood has helped 13,270 girls, scholars, wards, women, and other
persons. Many girls it has sent to swell the ranks of the Order of St.
Clara, while many have been married, for whom a dowry has always been
provided. The sum of 508,916 pesos, 4 tomins, 3 granos, has been spent
in this work. From its foundation until 1634, the brotherhood has
helped many girls in the school of Santa Potenciana, maintaining
besides many girls in private families. The number of such girls
exceeds seven thousand, many of whom have embraced the religious life,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=

to these latter. They have never refused to shelter abandoned children,
for whom they have cared tenderly, teaching them and sending them into
the life for which they are fitted.]</p>
<p class="par">The spiritual welfare must not be passed by in silence,
which has been and is being obtained for all this city, from the time
of the erection of the church called Santa Misericordia. There, every
Sunday, and day of observance, three masses are specially said: the
first between 4 and 5 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, from which follows
the spiritual consolation which the poor share, who, by their necessity
and poverty, cannot succeed in hearing it if it is not held at such an
hour; the second, at nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning, which is
attended by the majority of this city; and the third at eleven, so that
the poor slaves and servants of this city, after concluding their
domestic tasks, may attend it without failing in what pertains to their
obligation. Besides the above, there are many which are daily
celebrated in the said church, where on many occasions of the year
there is generally an open collectorship of masses, which are said with
the alms which the funds of this house produce.</p>
<p class="par">The expenses of this church in all that pertains to
divine worship and other functions which are frequent, both of the
interment of brothers, of their wives, and firstborn, and honors which
are shown them, both in attendance on those executed, their burial, and
other charitable exercises in which this brotherhood is employed,
exceed 118,438 pesos, 3 tomins, since the time of its foundation. It
excels in the adornment of its temple and in the neatness and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>glory of the things of divine worship and in that
of the priestly ornaments, and other things. This is all in charge of a
deputy of the board, who is annually appointed as chapel steward, so
that by the attention and care which he gives, it may all be done in a
fitting manner, without there being any omission, and so that there may
be no falling off of observance in said church and its sacristy.</p>

weekly to the Japanese beatas of San Miguel; and 3 pesos apiece to

two of the Moro hostages who have been brought from Jol&oacute;; all
the religious orders also having been asked to do the same. The

Spain of the wretched condition of the islands, occasioned by frequent
invasions, insurrections, repeated loss of ships, and exorbitant royal
duties charged in Acapulco. The ships lost are the following: in 1646,
the galleon &ldquo;San Luis,&rdquo; on the Cagayan coast, when coming
from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and the galleon &ldquo;Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora
de Buena Esperanza&rdquo; on the island of Negros, while returning from

galleon &ldquo;San Antonio de Padua&rdquo; in Mindoro with the
re&euml;nforcements which it is taking to Ternate; October 21, 1649,
the flagship &ldquo;Encarnacion&rdquo; on the coast of Bula, while

Joseph&rdquo; on the island of Luban, while coming from Camboja, and

1655, the galleon &ldquo;San Francisco Xavier,&rdquo; in the bay of
Boronga, while returning from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, with the loss of
many people, a new galleon which has been built in Camboja at great
expense, with the loss of many people; and two merchant ships with
goods belonging to the citizens of Manila; in 1656, two ships after
leaving for Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, put back; in 1669, two ships put back,
but leave in 1670, one of them being burned at Acapulco; and in 1672,
the ship &ldquo;San Thelmo&rdquo; puts back. No reenforcements come
from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a in the years 1647, 1652, 1662, and 1663. In
1662, the commerce of Macao is lost because of the Portuguese revolt
against Spain; and at that time the Portuguese seize a ship with 30,000
pesos which was intended for the purpose of war supplies for the
Spanish monarchy, and much property belonging to the citizens of
Manila. In 1647, a fleet of thirteen Dutch ships enters the bay of
Manila, where they demolish some of the fortifications, although they
are finally driven off, retiring to the northward where they inflict
much damage. The embassy of the Chinese pirate Cogsen under charge of
Fray Victorio Risio, O.P., throws the city into a flutter, and new
fortifications are pushed apace, a process which however, exhausts the
treasury and the citizens. Sabiniano Manrrique de Lara writes to the
brotherhood, under date of December 14, 1662, asking them to attend the
octave ordered to be held in the cathedral after Christmas. The
presidios of Ternate and Zamboanga are abandoned in view of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>the approaching trouble with the Chinese pirate.
An earthquake that occurs August 20, 1658, proves more disastrous than
that of 1645. Insurrections in several provinces in 1660 and 1661 are
put down only after great expense, as is that of the Chinese in 1672.
The brotherhood gives alms of more than ten thousand pesos in 1646 for
the equipment of the fleet that is to oppose the Dutch; in 1650, a
second loan of 13,740 pesos for the expenses of the treasury; another
loan of 7,601 pesos, 4 tomins in 1653, to aid the expenses of the royal
army; a fourth loan for the equipment of fleets and presidios; a fifth
of 61,526 pesos, 2 tomins: a total of 169,099 pesos, 2 tomins. In
addition to these loans, the brotherhood distributes alms to many
sources, between the years 1651&ndash;1690, the total sum of 172,467
pesos, 7 tomins, 6 granos. May 31, 1656, the purveyor and deputies
grant a transfer of the hospital and all its properties, etc., to the
hospital Order of St. John of God, on the condition that the purveyor
and deputies as patrons, may inspect the hospital once each year, and
if they note any defect or neglect report the same to the prior in
order that it may be remedied&mdash;a transfer made because of hard
times. The brotherhood continues to aid the hospital with many alms,
notwithstanding its own poverty.]</p>

17, 1660, excusing himself from attending certain ceremonies because of
stress of work, and makes provision for the running of the school of
Santa Isabel. Governor Manuel de Leon y Saravia founds a fund of 50,000
pesos for the benefit of the entire community in 1677, an action that
is imitated by Francisco Coloma, who leaves a principal of 4,000 pesos.
Fray Felipe Pardo establishes another pious fund in 1689 of 13,000
pesos, and in a letter of March 21 of that year, asks the brotherhood
to accept the same. Fray Andres Gonzales, bishop of Nueva Caceres,
writes in an appreciative vein to the brotherhood, and also founds a
pious fund. April 18, 1691, the dean of the cathedral also writes
appreciatively to the Misericordia. The latter, on the occasion of the
destructive earthquake of 1645, offers the use of its church to the
cabildo of the cathedral as that edifice has been quite destroyed.
November 26, 1652, the offer is accepted and a commission appointed by
the dean to settle conditions with the brotherhood. These conditions
relate to church service and procedure, both the cabildo and the
Misericordia making certain concessions. The religious orders of Manila
have at various times made mention of the Misericordia and its good
work to his Majesty, and the same thing has been done by governors and
archbishops. To these good reports, which are sent to his Majesty in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=

by which the brotherhood is declared exempt from visit by the ordinary,
archbishop, provisors during vacant see, or by any other ecclesiastical
minister; as well as the papal concessions that are made it. Our author
defends the exemption from visit against those who oppose it. Many
honors have been heaped upon the brotherhood during royal religious
ceremonies. Lastly, Governor Marquis de Torrecampo has shown honor and
appreciation to the association, on many occasions, even naming a new
ship which he had built &ldquo;Santo Christo de la Misericordia,&rdquo;

brotherhood in the loss of money and the necessities of the times, when
its expenses are increased disproportionally by the repair of its
church, college, office, hospital, distribution of alms for rebuilding
other edifices, and the remedy of other public necessities, at last
turn by the foundation of certain pious funds. The first is founded by
Manuel de Leon y Saravia, in 1677, and is for 50,000 pesos. In
imitation of him ten more funds are established, which produce alms
amounting to 170,956 pesos, 4 tomins up to the year 1700, which are
distributed for the spiritual and temporal needs of the poor, and for
other purposes.]</p>
<p class="par">At this time the possessions of Pedro Quintero
Nu&ntilde;es and those of Licentiate Manuel Suares de Olivera, as well
as the stockfarm of the royal alf&eacute;rez Joseph Correa, fell to the
house of Santa Misericordia. They have been and are of great profit to
the sick poor, and imprisoned, to some of the sacred orders, for the
blessed souls of purgatory, and other pious purposes. It is a fact that
up to the present <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74"
name="pb74">74</a>]</span>time, they have produced in benefit to all
the above, 105,258 pesos, 4 tomins, almost half of which was spent up
to the year 700, which would be doubtless of great consolation and
relief to the poverty and necessities of this community in times when
even the citizens, ill-satisfied by the blows of the past disasters,
were experiencing new outbreaks and losses in their wealth, by those
which happened frequently to the galleons of this line, from their
having to put back to port, and the embargo of the goods, which were
embarked therein. For from the year 673 until that of 700, trade
received signal injuries in the port of Acapulco, the merchandise of
the trade being embargoed during the years 676 and 677, in revenge for
having detained in this city at the advice of royal officials 330,000
pesos, which came in the year 675 from the citizens of Mexico in
violation of royal decrees. In another decree of 678, obtained by the
said citizens [of Mexico] by dint of very inaccurate reports, it was
ordered that those of this city return said sum, increased by interest
at the rate of twenty-five per cent. That shaving [<i lang=
"es">escalfe</i>] was made from the embargoed goods. From so notorious
setbacks, other losses of greater consideration followed; and from the
increase of excessive taxes which were imposed on those interested who
took the galleon &ldquo;San Antonio de Padua&rdquo; to the port of
Acapulco in the year 79, the citizens suffered very great setbacks. In
the year 682 the ship &ldquo;Santa Rosa&rdquo; put back, and in 86,
while attending to the preparation of the ship &ldquo;Santo
Ni&ntilde;o&rdquo; for Acapulco, news came that there was a squadron of
eleven hostile ships among the islands. On that account the voyage was
suspended and the ships were prepared to go out to oppose the said
squadron and guard the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75"
name="pb75">75</a>]</span>galleon which was expected with the succor
from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a.</p>
<p class="par">[Calamities are still in store for the Philippines. The
&ldquo;Santo Ni&ntilde;o&rdquo; leaves Cavite in 1687, but is forced to
put back in order to winter at Bagatao, and returns to Cavite with its
cargo half rotten. Reenforcements providentially come from Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a in 1688. In 1690, the almiranta while returning from
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a is lost in the Marianas, and although the people
are saved, the cargo is partly lost. The galleon &ldquo;Santo Christo
de Burgos&rdquo; is compelled to put back to Camarines to winter in
1692. Sailing once more in 1693, it is never again heard of. The
&ldquo;San Joseph&rdquo; is lost three days out from port in the island
of Luban, and many people are drowned. In 1696, as there is no galleon
to send to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, a patache is bought for the trade, but
the 74,000 pesos that it is compelled to pay in Acapulco for duties, is
so great a tax on the citizens of Manila that but little is left for
them. However, amid all these disasters, there is one bright ray,
namely in the pious funds that are established in the brotherhood. From
1673&ndash;1700, these funds realized 227,724 pesos, 3 tomins, which
are distributed among the poor and used for other purposes. Between the
years 1690&ndash;1701, the sum of 44,425 pesos, 3 tomins is realized
from investments and applied to pious ends.]</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The founders and brothers of this brotherhood,
considering the work and business in which they had to employ
themselves continually in fulfilment of the works of charity, prudently
decided and decreed by a chapter of the ordinances that there should be
250 brothers for the due fulfilment of all the ordinances, in whom good
report, sane conscience, honest life, fear of God, observance of His
commandments, and prompt obedience to all that should be of service to
God and to the brotherhood, and the relief of one&rsquo;s neighbor had
to be included. They declared that they should not be single, unless
they had reached the age of thirty, but that being virtuous persons and
of the said qualities, they might receive dispensation and be received
as brothers if they were twenty-five years old or upward. But no one
who was not an oldtime Christian, and no one who had any obligatory
duties that could prevent him from serving in the brotherhood [could be
a member]; neither could those who did not know how to read or to
write. Among said 250 brothers would be always the management and
government of the house, and the election of the officers, with
obligation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>to serve God by those who should be elected and
appointed by the purveyor and brothers of the board if there were no
legitimate obstacle to prevent that. Before they should be admitted as
brothers, the secretary of the house was to enter in the book of the
brotherhood that its ordinances should be submitted to them, so that
having seen and read them, they might determine whether they could
fulfil them. And if they were questioned by the board in regard to
them, and were found with a mind resolved to observe them and to serve
according to the rules in the brotherhood, an oath was to be taken from
them on the holy gospels in a missal before the purveyor and brothers
of the board, to the effect that when they should hear the signal of
the house, or the bells, with the sign that had been arranged for the
summoning of the brothers, they should come to the house to perform the
works of charity in accordance with the orders that they should receive
from the purveyor and brothers of the board; and also if they were
summoned in the name of the aforesaid and there was no legitimate
obstacle. The above was to be a matter of conscience. They were also to
swear to keep the secrets of the board and the rules, when they should
be summoned by the board, and were obliged, notwithstanding their oath,
to recite fourteen Pater Nosters and fourteen Ave Marias for the
deceased brothers, and, having done that, they were to be received as
brothers, and their names to be inscribed in the book of the
brotherhood.</p>

<p class="par first">Since we have to furl the sails to this discourse,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=

this small work in these last chapters, I thought it important to first
make an extract (although with much labor) of all the alms and sums of
pesos, produced by the funds which are administered by the house of
Santa Misericordia, during the years when&mdash;all being complete, and
no disaster of earthquakes coming upon them, or shipwrecks or other
accidents, which depend on time&mdash;it distributes to the benefit of
all this community. I was also moved to this interesting task by making
charts of all the funds and their pious purposes, by having met in the
first part of the life of the venerable and most reverend father
master, Fray Simon de Roxas, a great servant of God and a member of the
Order of the Santissima Trinidad de Redemptores [<i>i.e.</i>, the Most
Holy Trinity of Redeemers].<a class="noteref" id="xd24e894src" href=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=

de Arcos, preacher and theologue of his Majesty, and of the tribunals
of his royal conscience, etc., in which he refers to a paragraph of a
letter which Juan Baptista Laba&ntilde;a wrote during the voyage from
Portugal of Don Phelipe III (of happy memory), in which he cited folio
16; and in the life of the said venerable father, a description of the
alms which the royal house of Santa Misericordia of the court of Lisboa
distributed in the year 619, and of those which regularly and annually
it distributes in the pious ends which are contained in the said
chapter, is found in book 8, chapter x, pp. 418&ndash;420. It states
that those alms are about 30,000 ducados annually. Inasmuch as chapter
xi of this work states that the alms distributed by this house of Santa
Misericordia of the city of Manila amounted to about 70,000 pesos, I
have determined to prove the said proposition part by part, passing
over the circumstances which are found in the said chapter, and making
a clear demonstration of their reality, without failing one jot in the
truth, which is required in a matter of so great importance, and which
has to yield in so great glory to the Spanish monarchy. It is a pity
that in the circumstances of the present case, there should be many who
opposed the truth as it did not issue so clear and apparent in all the
books of the house which treat of this matter; and necessarily I am
obliged to give it by imagining charts which are fitting and do not
leave the least reason for doubt. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84"
href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">This having been granted, therefore, I assert that the
alms and sums of pesos received by the holy cathedral church and the
sacred orders of this city, the beaterios, confraternities, the
venerable tertiary order, the house for sheltered women, the hospice of
San Jacinto, the colleges (without including that of Santa
Misericordia, St. John of God and its infirmary), the province of
Camarines, and the Indians of Marinas Islands, amount to 25,520 pesos.
In the alms given for masses, 5,777 pesos are also distributed as a
suffrage for the blessed souls of purgatory; among the poor prisoners
of this city, 2,691 pesos; as a benefit to the school of Santa Isabel,
which belongs to the brotherhood, in the divine worship of its church,
the salary of its chaplains, servants of the house, support, clothing
and other things which are spent for the girl collegiates (the number
of those at present are 58 inmates, rectress, and portress, 9 wards,
and 6 slave women, who serve in it), and repairs of said school (in
which alone this present year about 6,000 pesos have been spent), they
give and apply 10,700 pesos; as dowries for the said girl collegiates
and other orphan daughters of noble parents of this city, 16,000 pesos;
for the relief of the necessities of poor Spaniards, widows,
self-respecting poor, 6,936 pesos. Besides these sums 3,000 pesos are
set aside for the benefit of the above-mentioned purposes which, with
somewhat more, are produced by the sums at interest, and also 1,200
pesos which are yielded by the encomienda which his Majesty applied to
the Board of Santa Misericordia in the provinces of the Ylocos and
Leite. Therefore totaling up the eight items of pesos above applied,
the amount is 71,824 pesos produced by the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>funds
administered by this house, as is adjusted with the greatest exactness.
One may see by the sums that result to the benefit of so many pious
ends, the reality and truth of the said proposition, and consequently,
the great succor of silver for the relief of the needs of its neighbor.
Surely I believe that in this small work of rich treasures, an
extraordinary splendor for the house must shine forth (with the new
discovery of so abundant a mine, which has been buried in silence in
the extensive field and space of 134 years); a prodigy which looks to
Spain for the non-moderation of this great house of Misericordia in the
most remote parts of the world. I believe that without injury to the
greater (if it can be that there is another which exceeds it), it
merited as panegyrist of its glories (although with more time) a nature
suitable to its worth and greatness. Lastly placed in the royal crown
of Espa&ntilde;a, it will be one of the most precious stones which
beautify that crown with its rich splendor, for the greater honor and

the work accomplished by the Misericordia from its foundation (in 1594)
up to 1730. &ldquo;This house has endowed twenty-three thousand orphan
girls, the daughters of Spaniards; it has spent in their maintenance
five hundred and eight thousand, nine hundred and sixteen pesos. It has
supplied to our Catholic monarch in pressing emergencies four hundred
and forty-nine thousand, four hundred and eighteen pesos. It has
expended in Divine worship one hundred and fifty-five thousand, seven
hundred and eighty-four pesos; and it has given in alms four million,
one hundred and thirteen thousand, two hundred and seven pesos. This
statement of expenditures is accurate, and is drawn from the original
books of the said house. In the life of the venerable Fray Simon de
Roxas, book 8, fol. 418, it is mentioned as unprecedented that the
Misericordia of Lisboa in one year gave in alms thirty thousand
ducados; but that of Manila gives every year seventy-one thousand,

of the Holy Trinity was founded primarily by St. John of Matha, a
native of Provence who was ordained to the priesthood. On the occasion
of his first mass, he determined to devote himself to the redemption of
Christian captives from the Mahometans. Retiring for a season of prayer
to the cell of the aged French hermit, St. Felix of Valois, the latter
approved the plan, and in 1197, they both went to Rome where they
obtained the approbation of Pope Innocent III for the erection of a new
order. The pope ordered the bishop of Paris and the abbot of St. Victor
to draw up the rules for the order, which received papal sanction in
1198. A white habit with a red and blue cross on the breast was
assigned as a distinctive dress. It received a new confirmation and
additional privileges by a papal bull of 1209. The French monarch
Philippe Auguste authorized the existence of the order in his kingdoms,
and Gauthier III, lord of Ch&acirc;tillon, granted them land for a
convent. Later as the order increased, the latter, seconded by the
king, granted them Cerfroid, near Grandlieu, on the borders of Valois,
which became the chief house of the order. The two saints founded many
houses in France. Many Christian slaves were ransomed in Morocco and
Spain. It was a fundamental rule of the order that at least one-third
of its revenues should be set aside for the redemption of captives. It
was estimated in the seventeenth century that since its foundation the
order had ransomed 30,720 Christian captives. At one time there were as
many as two hundred and fifty houses. See Baring Gould&rsquo;s <i>Lives
of the Saints</i>, ii, pp. 226&ndash;230; and Addis and Arnold&rsquo;s

<h3 class="main">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE CITY OF MANILA</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The island of Luzon (it is also called Nueva
Castilla) is the largest of all those which submit to the Catholic
crown in this Philippine archipelago. Its figure is that of an arm
somewhat doubled, and the latest observations give it three hundred and
fifty leguas of circumference, and two hundred leguas of length. Its
width cannot be accurately stated, because the land is in some places
broad and in others narrow, although it is known that it is longer from
the elbow to the shoulder, and in that distance it is noticed that the
greatest width is forty-three leguas; and it is about twenty-two leguas
from the elbow to the hand of this imaginary arm. In this remotest
part, then, of the Spanish domain, in 14&deg; 48&prime; of northern
latitude and 158&deg; 38&prime; of eastern longitude, is situated
Manila,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e941src" href="#xd24e941" name=
"xd24e941src">2</a> nearly in the middle of its mainland, in the region
of the elbow of its [imaginary] figure; and there, as being the capital
of all the Spanish possessions in the Philipinas Islands, resides
permanently the royal Audiencia with its president the captain-general,
the archiepiscopal see, and other tribunals. The number of citizens who
distinguish the city is astonishingly small; these are the Spaniards
who live within the walls, and in the wards of Binondoc <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>and
Santa Cruz, which adjoin it; and although in these places there is an
astonishing number of people, I have the idea that they are a
contemptible rabble, excepting the small number of the Spaniards. It
was June 24, 1571, when Manila was founded, and it recognizes as its
founder the adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legazpi&mdash;a hero in truth,
worthy of the greatest praises for the bravery, judgment, and good
fortune by which he was distinguished in these conquests.</p>
<p class="par">The site which this town occupies<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e954src" href="#xd24e954" name="xd24e954src">3</a> is a point of
land on the shores of the sea, in a bay thirty leguas in circumference;
into this falls a river of considerable size, which comes down from a
lake distant five leguas from the city on the eastern side&mdash;by
which it flows, surrounding the city, and in its progress washes its
walls, until it pours its waters through the bar.</p>
<p class="par">Up to this time the secular government has been in
charge of forty governors, twenty-three of them proprietary, and
seventeen <i lang="la">ad interim</i>. The ecclesiastical government
likewise has had one bishop and thirteen archbishops. Both these
numbers are carefully estimated from the list of [those who have held]
both dignities.</p>

</div>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=

<p class="par">The fortifications with which this town is girt about
are everywhere of irregular shape, in accordance with the surface of
the ground. Its walls, although of masonry, are not regarded as
inferior&mdash;if one considers the good quality of the stone, which is
easy to work on account of being soft&mdash;to those of mud or brick.
On the other hand, I am persuaded that an injustice would be done to
our walls if one should deny them the advantage of the former kind and
the solidity of the latter, in view of their great resistance; for in
the course of more than a century since their construction, some slight
decay has been noticed only occasionally, and in places here and there
little sheltered from the salt winds; and this is remedied, or the wall
is preserved, by applying a thin coat of lime, an idea which has come
as the result of experience. Its circuit appears to be 12,498 Castilian
feet, both its extremities closing in with the castle of Santiago,
which, on account of its position, occupies in Manila the place of the
citadel.</p>
<p class="par">The bastions in its circuit are twelve, all furnished
with terreplein; nine are small, and the others large, of the regular
size. In one of these last, named &ldquo;San Andres,&rdquo; there is a
powder-magazine, bomb-proof, which the present governor caused to be
constructed; an incentive to building this was the little shelter
afforded by a mere shed in former times, and the exposed condition of
its contents to the shots of a besieger; these risks that were feared
have ceased at sight of the present fortification. There are two
sentry-towers incorporated with the said wall, and besides this there
are a ravelin and a crown-work. All this is a very respectable
aggregate, as contributing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href=
"#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>to the greatest defense of the city;
the situation of each of these defenses will be described in the proper
place.</p>
<p class="par">The gates of this city are six, two main entrances and
four posterns. Of these Santa Lucia and Palacio, which look toward the
west, allow passage to the shore&mdash;as also on the north side Santo
Domingo and Almacenes give passage to the river. The main gates are
distinguished by the names Real and Parian. The latter is situated in
the middle of the curtain which faces the northeast between the San
Lorenzo and San Gabriel bastions; and inside of it is its
guard-station, capacious enough to lodge a company of men.
Corresponding to the empty space below, in the upper part it has a
spacious sentry-tower, furnished with some cannons, which, by favor of
its sides defends the collateral bulwarks&mdash;a fortification which,
it may be supposed, was placed here in order to make up for the defect
of the extraordinary length of this curtain.</p>
<p class="par">The outer works of this are thus composed: a crown-work,
which masks the gate; a fausse-braye [<i lang="es">falsabraga</i>],
which extends from the flank of the bastion San Gabriel, until it
almost reaches the said gate, there leaving room for a little bridge
for communication with the crown-work already mentioned; a ditch, of
which we shall treat further on; its covered way, parapet, and
palisade, with its esplanade, the whole regularly surrounded, so far as
the narrowness of the place permits; and at its foot a quagmire, which
serves as an outer ditch. At the end of this, and along its outer
margin, extending toward the south, there is a grand highway, which at
its beginning is joined with another but small <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>road,
which lies between the outer ditch and the river; and both of these
connect with a little bridge, next to a small fort which was erected
for the guards stationed at the large bridge which, close by, crosses
the river.</p>
<p class="par">The ditch of the half-curtain (of which mention was
reserved for this place, in order to avoid confusion) is formed by the
waters which overflow from the river at the rise of the tides. It
starts from the angle defended by the bastion San Gabriel, and extends
until it is very near the Parian gate, with a counterscarp&mdash;which
there leaves it, bending toward the crown-work, and thus is left almost
isolated, with a small arm. This, a little farther, adds all its
waters, as if on deposit, to the outer ditch already mentioned. Not
thus the main ditch; for this, overflowing the right side according to
the amount of water which it receives [from the river], continues its
course along the margin of the grand highway, more or less closely
according to its curves, until, coming close to the walls, it ends its
course round about them, close to the bastion San Diego. At this place
art has imposed restraints on it, having in mind, no doubt, the
frequent inundations to which that vicinity would be exposed if (as was
easy for it) this ditch should come to unite its waters with the sea.
From this measure of prudence resulted two benefits of special
importance, in which both the fortified post and the public are
directly interested&mdash;the former, on account of the advantage which
it enjoys (as may be seen in the plan) in the fact that the ditch
serves it as a moat on the eastern and southern sides; and the latter,
because it is utilized for the great number of vessels which, aided
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>by the rising tide, come up to the Puerta Real to
discharge their lading.</p>
<p class="par">This is one of the two principal gates already
mentioned. It is located on the southern side of this town, in the
curtain which defends the bastions San Diego and San Andres, although
nearer to the latter; and it much resembles the gate of the Parian
(although built in different style) in its convenience and its
fortifications&mdash;for it has, like the former, a guard-station and
watchtower, similarly arranged and equipped. It is only noted that this
curtain, peculiar among all, is the only one which is furnished with
terreplein; for this reason some cannons (which defense the others
lack) have been placed in it.</p>
<p class="par">Its other exterior works, arranged according to their
order, are reduced to a bridge that can be raised, a moat with its
counterscarp faced with stone [<i lang="es">revestido</i>], and at a
little distance a ravelin in condition for
defense&mdash;notwithstanding which, on account of masking the gate it
is not found in front of the half of the curtain which was its proper
place. Although this gate had the remaining features of covered way,
parapet, palisade, and esplanade, they were entirely in ruins at the
time when this government began&mdash;which induced us to plan them
anew, in modern style, and of much better quality than were the old
ones.</p>
<p class="par">All the curtains which face the western and northern
part of this fortress are, without question, the weakest part of its
defenses; but on the supposition (which is believed to be a remote
contingency) that European armies may move to attack it in
earnest&mdash;and it may be regarded as an enormous undertaking by our
enemies here, who are most laughable on <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb95" href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>account of their lack of
discipline and of forts&mdash;the natural defenses are apparently even
more than sufficient. For it has on the west the waters of the bay for
a moat, and on the north a river that is broad and deep; and with this
all fears may be laid aside.</p>
<p class="par">There is also maintained in this city, at the expense of
the royal treasury (as being a necessity), a foundry for artillery,
grenades, and cannon balls of all calibers; and an iron-furnace, where
men are continually forging, according to the occasion, many
hand-weapons and some firearms. The metals for these are transported
from countries beyond the sea. Besides these, a scant half-legua to the
south, is the powder-factory, which is enclosed by a triangular redoubt
of stone and mortar, with seven mounted iron cannons, and fortified by
three demi-bastions. This factory supplies gunpowder to Manila and the
forts dependent on it; to the ships of his Majesty which sail annually
to the port of Acapulco and the Marianas Islands; to the armadas which,
when any danger from enemies arises, are made ready on the opposite
shore; and to the public festivals. More than enough to cover the
expense is received from those who wish to buy it, to whom it is
furnished for their money. The ingredients of its composition are
produced in the country, except the saltpetre, which is brought from
foreign countries.</p>

<h3 class="main">THE CASTLE OF SANTIAGO</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It has a circuit of 2,030 feet; its shape is
almost triangular. Its fortifications on the southern side, which faces
the city, include a curtain with terreplein, flanked by two
demi-bastions; it has a fausse-braye, and a ditch which communicates
with the river. On the northern side, toward the entrance of the ditch,
in place of a bastion is raised a cavalier with three faces or
batteries; one of these fronts the sea (the anchorage included),
another the said entrance, and the third the river itself. This last
side of the cavalier joins a large tower of the same height as the
walls; and through the tower there is a descent to a semi-circular
platform or battery, at the level of the water, with which the
aforesaid triangular figure of this castle is completed. Through these
sides the fort has the necessary communication with the city, through
its principal gate, which faces that way; with the river, and with the
shore or beach of the sea, by a postern gate <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>which
furnishes passage to it. All the above will be better understood by
referring to the proper plan folio [<i>blank in MS.</i>] where also
will be found, placed in their order, the guard-stations, the barracks
of the troops who garrison it, and the quarters of the warden and his
subalterns. The reduced size of the plan has not allowed room for
showing other buildings distinctly, such as the chapel, various
storehouses (among these the powder-magazine, which is bomb-proof), the
dungeons, the reservoirs of water, etc.</p>

an orderly aide-de-camp, an alf&eacute;rez, a sergeant, and five minor
posts&mdash;those of page, standard-bearer, fifer, and two drummers. It
has sixty regular soldiers, one head gunner, and twelve artillerymen.
The fort has also, as workmen in the shops, Pampango soldiers in a
company of infantry, with their captain, alf&eacute;rez, sergeant, the
three minor posts of standard-bearer, fifer, and drummer, and ninety
regular soldiers, three of them receiving extra pay.</p>
<p class="par">The wages and rations of the said troops are paid
monthly, in the form which is shown in the following schedule:</p>
<p class="par"><i>Officers</i>: The warden, 66 pesos, 5 tomins; his
lieutenant, 15 p.; the aide-de-camp, 5 p., 6 t.; the alf&eacute;rez, 4

<h3 class="main">DESCRIPTION OF CAVITE</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In sight of Manila, and south-southeast of it, at
a distance of three leguas by way of the waters of the bay, and six
short leguas by land&mdash;in 14&deg; 31&prime; of north latitude, and
158&deg; 38&prime; of east longitude&mdash;is the port of Cavite, which
is formed by a tongue of land, curved from east to west; it is 5,100
feet long, and 1,200 feet broad. It is the ordinary anchorage for the
ships of his Majesty and of private persons, as well as for the
pataches belonging to the commerce of the various Oriental peoples, who
come here to carry it on every year, at regular times.</p>
<p class="par">Its population is composed of the soldiers who garrison
its castle, and those of other posts; the sea-faring men who serve in
the vessels of the [Acapulco] trade-route, and in various other
vessels, in the royal service; and the men who compose the force of the
navy-yard, for the repair and the building of ships. Among so many, the
citizens of most prominence are the pilots, boatswains, and other
officers of the ships and the Ribera. The entire
government&mdash;political, military, and social&mdash;is in the hands
of a warden and chief magistrate, who is not responsible to any one
except the captain-general.</p>
<p class="par">Its principal fortification consists of the fort San
Phelipe, the shape of which is an irregular quadrilateral; it is
situated toward the point of the Ribera, at a distance from it of about
1,100 feet. It has four bastions with orillons, in old style; its
western curtain, in which is its gate, has a fausse-braye; and its
southern curtain, on the shore of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>Ribera, has a
barbette battery of twenty mounted cannons. A similar account of the
two remaining curtains is omitted, because in them there is nothing new
for notice. The circuit of the fort is 1,410 feet; and within it are
located, in due order, lodgings sufficient for the soldiers in its
garrison, an armory, a powder-magazine, a water reservoir, and other
offices necessary to the service.</p>
<p class="par">On the western side, which is contiguous with the
village of San Roque, this fort is also fortified by a curtain 540 feet
long, which, with the two large towers which flank it, occupies the
entire width of the tongue of land, and, with a revetted moat, leaves
Cavite almost isolated; it would be feasible to make it entirely so by
the union of the two bodies of seawater&mdash;with experience of fatal
results, if the double defense of a counterscarp were not interposed.
This curtain has, as a mask to its gate, a half-star work with its own
gate, which is the one that people call Puerta Vaga; and these two
entrances furnish, for the said town and Manila, the only passage by
land that is found in this port.</p>
<p class="par">To this fortification is added another, and of no less
importance, the necessity of which was made evident by warnings; and
the plan of its structure was thought out by experience. For, having
noted in less than fifty years the repeated ravages caused in this
port, on the north side, by the violence of the sea when driven by the
north winds&mdash;which indicated its entire destruction in the
future&mdash;the superior government decided to construct a stable
barrier, by which the so great damage that was feared might be
prevented. This was carried out by the engineer then in charge, by
constructing in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103"
name="pb103">103</a>]</span>water a barrier of stone and mortar, large
enough to be able to resist such attacks, and of height equal to that
of the highest tides, on a foundation of pile-work and beams. This work
extended from the point of the Ribera, on the side which was
endangered, until it reached the northern tower of the curtain which is
mentioned in the preceding paragraph&mdash;that is, the entire length
of Cavite. Upon this breakwater he raised a parapet with its banquette,
in which were formed the bastions, demi-bastions, flanks and curtains,
as this line gave opportunity, and in the plan of Cavite they are
indicated; but all these works were at the level of the water. For its
greater permanency, command was given to cast into the water outside,
at the foot of the pile-work, a number of stone-heaps; since these are
always multiplying themselves, an evident benefit has resulted.</p>
<p class="par">The arms and supplies for the maintenance of these forts
are those which here are scheduled.</p>

are considered collectively) comprise three companies of Spanish
infantry&mdash;one commanded by the warden, another by the
sargento-mayor, and another by a captain&mdash;with 180 soldiers in
all, with their leading officers and minor posts. There is also a
captain of artillery, with twenty-four artillerymen; the deputy of the
castellan; three orderlies; two carpenters for the gun-carriages of the
artillery; and one military notary. There is, besides, a company of
Pampango infantry with its master-of-camp, sargento-mayor, and other
officers, with two hundred and twenty regular soldiers, one hundred and
twenty of whom are assigned to work as sawyers. All the officers and
soldiers, both Spaniards and Pampangos (except the warden and the
notary) receive a suitable ration of rice and their pay in cash
monthly. The wages amount to 11,500 pesos, and the rations to 3,084
fanegas of rice. These are furnished from the royal treasury and the
storehouses in Manila, according to the list here set down.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Officers</i>: The warden, 100 pesos; the

<p class="par">The place which is now called &ldquo;Ribera of
Cavit&eacute;&rdquo; includes all the ground from the point of
Cavit&eacute; to Fort San Phelipe. All this is enclosed, with two
gates, [which are] at the angles flanked by the bastions&mdash;that of
the powder-magazine on the northern side, and by that of
Ch&aacute;chara [<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;Chit-chat&rdquo;] on the southern
side. Although these passages had formerly been open, it was considered
best to shut them off thus, in order to check the frequent thefts that
were committed of nails and other furnishings at times when ships were
being repaired or built; but in doing so a narrow strip was left, in
order to furnish a path for the work-people from the Ribera, thus
forming the barbette battery; and this strip has preserved the
principal curtain of the fort from the continual former lashings of the
waves of the sea.</p>

also includes the royal iron-works, where are forged the iron tools and
instruments, of all kinds and sizes, that are necessary for the said

the masts, anchors, cables, rigging, and other kinds of cordage; for
cannon, and for gun-carriages; and generally for all the military
supplies and nautical equipments, with the dwelling-houses of their
principal officers. All this was built by the present government, and
with so good management that in a short time, and without confusion,
everything necessary for this purpose was constructed, repaired, or
equipped. Other royal buildings which are not included in the Ribera

the storehouses of Yloylo the rice and other provisions which are
needed in this post [of Samboangan]. The amount needed for the pay of
these seamen is sent from the royal treasury of Manila.</p>
<p class="par">The entire maintenance of this post of Samboangan
amounts each year to 12,592 pesos, 2 tomins, and 7,108 cavans (which
are 3,554 fanegas) of rice, according to the last balancing of the
accounts. To meet this expense, a situade is sent from the royal

the fixed charges, and to that of the accidental expenses when there
are any. The clothing, gun-powder, supplies for replenishing the
storehouses, cordage and sails, other supplies for vessels, supplies
for the hospital and other offices of that post&mdash;all these are
provided from the royal storehouses of Manila; while from those of
Yloylo is sent the rice for the rations, with other foodstuffs, in

Balayan, Mindoro, Caraga, Marivelez, Calamianes, and Cavite being
exempted from this contribution&mdash;the amount of which is regularly
more than 3,500 pesos a year. For the said expenses is also applied the
value of the wine monopoly, which, at the rate of the last sale to the

<p class="par first">There are at present thirty-nine apostolic
missionaries, distributed among twenty-one active missions which are
situated in various places and provinces, who are engaged in the
conversion and settlement of the infidels who dwell in the mountains in
the greater number of these islands. Of these, one is a secular
ecclesiastic; four belong to the calced Augustinian religious; five are
discalced Franciscans; twenty are Dominicans; two belong to the Society
of Jesus, and seven to the Augustinian Recollects. Aid is given to them
on the account of his Majesty, in accordance with his royal decrees, by
the stipend of 100 pesos and 100 fanegas of rice to each missionary,
and with the military escorts necessary to their protection and to the
safety of the subdued Indians. Likewise they receive a monthly
allowance for these men, of one peso and one cavan of rice [for each],
to which is added the cost of transporting this provision to the places
where they are, which sometimes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144"
href="#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>amounts to as much as the
value of the principal. The mission which now is especially considered
to have made the greatest progress and advancement is that established
in the mountains of Ytuy and Paniqui in the province of Cagay&agrave;n,
in charge of the religious of the Order of St. Dominic&mdash;who,
penetrating into the country, a task which had previously been greatly
facilitated by the calced religious of the Order of St. Augustine, have
brought that province into communication with the others in this great
island (something which formerly could not be done, except by sea),
with great harvest of souls who have been converted to our holy
Catholic faith. These costs are stated in the following summary, that
which belongs to each mission being given separately.</p>

<p class="par">In order better to understand these tables, no estimate
is made, in the class of secular ecclesiastics, of the additional sums
which many of them enjoy from the treasury besides the amounts from the
tributes to which they minister, for the amount required for their
subsistence, in accordance with the royal decrees and acts of the
treasury council obtained at the beginning of their establishment; and
this surplus causes the disparity which cannot fail to be noticed. In
the province of Tayabas, which is administered by the religious of St.
Francis, there is no charge for rice, since this is always included in
the amount of cash [supplied from the treasury]&mdash;as was agreed
between this order, the governor, and the royal officials, on account
of the scarcity [of supplies] in that province, and the difficulties
which are found in the remittance, transportation, and delivery of that
commodity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">It is also set forth that, after the budget for the
provinces was drawn up, and the number of tributes in them realized, it
was resolved in a conference of the royal treasury officials to abolish
the register of strolling Indians, reducing them to a poll-list like
the rest of the tribute-payers. According to these latest enumerations
the amounts of the stipends are settled, and not in accordance with
those which were considered in the aforesaid budget&mdash;from which
fact arises the difference which is found in this one.</p>

<p class="par">Consequently, the payments in kind being reduced to
money at the prices which are indicated, according to the estimate made
every five years&mdash;in which are considered the transportation
expenses, items of waste, and cost of administration&mdash;the whole
amounts to 162,530 pesos, 1 tomin, and 6 granos, according to the
computation. This amount is annually requisitioned by the royal
officials from the amount of the tributes and other branches of income
indifferently, in such a manner that when the Indians fail&mdash;either
in order to keep a reserve, or for some other special reason of
scarcity&mdash;to pay the portion of rice which is required from them,
it is necessary to make extraordinary purchases on his Majesty&rsquo;s
account, at the prices which at the time are current, in order to
furnish the ecclesiastical estate with a suitable amount for their
stipend. It is also necessary that the aid for each individual
ecclesiastic be delivered, at the cost of the royal treasury, in his
respective place of ministry, from which follows an increased and
extraordinary expense in the transportation of these succors.</p>
<p class="par">As regards the wine for masses, the royal officials
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>of this treasury usually ask those of Mexico to
send in each ship 500 arrobas of wine, which, it is estimated, ought to
be distributed among the communities and ministries of the
religious&mdash;considering that the secular ecclesiastics are
accustomed to receive this in money, at the same rate of twenty-five
pesos [an arroba]. The officials of Mexico punctually fill this order,
deducting from the situado the cost of purchasing the wine and
transporting it to the port of Acapulco&mdash;so that, when delivered
in this city, and allowance being made for the waste, the total cost
never falls below twenty-five pesos [an arroba]. As the aforesaid waste
is usually considerable, on account of the long navigation and carrying
the wine in [mule-] loads by land&mdash;and from the amount thus sent
is separated, in the first place, the wine necessary for the use of the
royal chapel and of the chaplains of the royal Audiencia, [and for the
celebration of mass in] the forts of Santiago and San Phelipe, at the
timber-cutting [by the Indians], and in the ships of his
Majesty&mdash;there is seldom enough wine to furnish the entire arroba
which belongs to each priest. For this reason the net amount of what
remains is divided <i lang="la">pro rata</i> among the aforesaid
communities and ministries of religious, without keeping back the third
part (as formerly was the custom) for emergency cases, on account of
the urgent representations made on this point by the general
procurators of the aforesaid communities&mdash;giving as their reason
that this reserve would be safer and better guarded in their hands than
in the royal storehouses, and there would be reason to fear that the
wine would be consumed or adulterated. The matter having been
considered at a session of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href=
"#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>the royal treasury officials on
December 5, 1738, it was decided that the royal officials should
proceed to deliver the wine, obliging the parties concerned to provide
for themselves whatever lack might occur in the future, to which all
agreed; in virtue of this, from that time was delivered to them all
that was their share in the <i lang="la">pro rata</i> division of the
net amount of all the wine that was on hand for this purpose.</p>
<p class="par">As for the cocoanut-oil for the lamps, there is seldom
any change in the amount paid to the churches; for it is the current
practice, in all the provinces where that tree grows, that the Indians
contribute it on account of the tribute, at the fixed price of one real
for a ganta, and at the same price when it must be purchased, which the
natives call &ldquo;bandala.&rdquo; If there is any excess of cost, it
is in the fact that oil is bought on urgent occasions in this city for
the careening of the vessels and other special needs of the royal
service&mdash;for which as regards the contributions [to the churches],
only so much is levied [from the Indians] as accords with the amount
agreed on [with them].</p>
<p class="par">Besides this enormous amount of stipends and offerings
with which his Majesty aids the ecclesiastical estate, the ministers in
charge of the villages of Indian converts have generally introduced the
annual collection, from the parishioners under their administration, of
three reals from each whole tribute (that is, a man and wife) and from
an unmarried man half that amount, as an offering, for the feasts of
the titular saint of the village, the monument, and All Saints&rsquo;
day; this also realizes a considerable sum for them, which may be more
clearly understood by the statement which is presented in the following

<p class="par">Consequently the 341 ministers in charge who administer
the 415 villages and 53 visitas, and in them the number of
184,814&frac12; tributes of native Indians, mestizos, and Christian
Sangleys&mdash;according to the latest estimate, in which is included
the enumeration of strolling Indians&mdash;receive for the aforesaid
offering each year 69,305 pesos, 3 tomins, and 6 granos, according to
those figures. It cannot be learned that for the exaction of this
offering they have further permission or privilege than the custom
itself, introduced by those very ecclesiastics and religious in their
respective parishes; nor in this accountancy is there any other
evidence for it than the extra-judicial information acquired by the
alcaldes, the natives, and the business men of the provinces, who have
seen this practice in use in the manner which is here stated. The
amount of this offering added to the 162,530 pesos, 1 tomin, and 6
granos which those ministers receive in stipends and contributions on
his Majesty&rsquo;s account, makes the sum <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>of
231,835 pesos, and 5 tomins, which is the amount of the fixed revenue
which they receive. Besides this, they have the proceeds of the
occasional fees from marriages, burials, baptisms, and other parochial
dues, which are collected in all the parishes that are called curacies
and ministries; and no account is rendered of the value of these,
because it has not been possible to calculate it everywhere for the
total computation of the usufruct, but it has always been considered as
a large amount. Notwithstanding all this, the religious orders have
their incomes lessened by transporting a large number of religious from
the kingdoms of Castilla to these islands, at least every six years. In
this way they consume a great part of their means, since the
passage-money which his Majesty grants them for their transportation is
a very limited sum. More than all, we must not fail to remark that the
fine appearance of the churches, and the care taken for divine worship
and education, and the zeal for souls, which are so conspicuous in the
ministries of the religious, cause more admiration than can be
expressed, in places so remote as these and in a Christian church so
recently formed. The point most worthy of consideration is the
subordination and reverence which these natives maintain toward their
religious teachers, permitting the latter to flog them, impose penances
on them, and rebuke them, when they incur blame in any omissions or
faults, without their being offended at the minister. It may therefore
truthfully be affirmed that it is these ministers who preserve in
obedience, vassalage, and subjection all the neophytes, gathered into
settlements&mdash;more being due to the authority and despotic manner
in which the fathers rule them than to the political <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>scheme of the alcaldes who govern them. This
arises, as the Indians themselves admit, from a natural fear which they
conceive for the father&rsquo;s superiority, through a hidden influence
which constrains them to feel thus, without knowing how, but which we
understand&mdash;supernatural effects of the lofty and supreme
Providence. This result is greatly aided by the care which the fathers
take in instructing, encouraging, and stimulating them in labor and
cultivation, and the management of their domestic affairs, in which
they are thereby benefited. Would that they might devote themselves at
once to suppressing the variety of languages which the natives use
(which serve only to keep alive the root of their abuses and
idolatries), as is done by the crown of Portugal in all its
conquests&mdash;gradually bringing them to the use of the Castilian
language, and endeavoring to secure instruction therein in all the
schools, as is ordained by law xviii, book vi, tit. i of the <i lang=
"es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i> of these kingdoms, in order that its
purpose, so holy and just, may be attained. But I have not been able to
find a convincing reason for their not putting this law into execution,
although I have made efforts to ascertain if there were any. It may
therefore be inferred that some insuperable and hidden difficulty must
have been encountered on the part of the religious who are ministers in
the doctrinas, which has hindered the useful and desirable progress of
this Christian maxim of policy.</p>

Ventura del Arco MSS. (Ayer library), iv, pp. 335&ndash;408, is the
transcript of an interesting document&mdash;&ldquo;Information
furnished by Don Jos&eacute; Antonio Ni&ntilde;o de Villavicencio in
regard to the situation of the town of Zamboanga; its original
subordination to the royal crown; its fortification, dismantling, and
reestablishment; the condition in which it was in 1737; its expenses;
and the amounts which it paid toward these.&rdquo; After a sketch
(illustrated by various official documents) of the early history of
Zamboanga as a military post, he relates its dismantling, and its
reestablishment by Bustamante; this latter is begun on April 5, 1719,
under the command of General Gregorio Padilla y Escalante, and its fort
is named &ldquo;Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Pilar de Zaragoza.&rdquo;
Villavicencio carefully describes the fort, and presents an itemized
statement of the expenses of maintaining it&mdash;which amount to
20,000 pesos annually, besides a reserve fund of 5,000 pesos which may
be drawn upon for extraordinary and urgent expenses. The salary of the
governor and military commander is 396 pesos a year. Two Jesuit
chaplains are kept there, who receive each 100 pesos annually. There
are eighteen other officers (commissioned and non-commissioned), and
two hundred privates; also five other officials, including a surgeon.
Besides this force of Spaniards is a company of Pampango
soldiers&mdash;a hundred men and five officers; and a considerable
number of men are also employed as rowers, builders, coast-guards, and
seamen. Rations amounting to 9,855 cavans of rice are allowed in the
budget of expenses; and the sum of 5,000 pesos is allowed yearly for
ammunition and military supplies for this post. The rice and other
provisions are mainly furnished from the provinces of Iloilo and Panay,
on account of their fertility and their nearness to Zamboanga. A
considerable part of the expenses of that post is obtained from the
contribution made by the inhabitants of the subjugated provinces, each
tributario giving annually a ganta of clean rice; this amounts to
109,503 gantas of clean rice&mdash;equivalent, at the rate of twenty
gantas cleaned to 48 gantas of palay, to 10,950 cavans of the
latter&mdash;which is estimated to be worth, at the prices paid by the
royal officials, 5,356 pesos. Enumeration is made of the numbers of
tributes paid in various provinces, as follows: Tondo, 5,606&frac12;;
Bulacan, 4,963&frac12;; Pampanga, 8,067; Pangasinan, 10,896&frac12;;
Ilocos, 8,665&frac34;; Cagayan, 5,218&frac12;; Laguna de Bay, 6,795;
Tayabas, 1,612&frac12;; Camarines, 7,512; Albay, 3,481; Panay,
6,170&frac12;; Yloilo, 10,406&frac12;; Island of Negros, 503&frac12;;
Leite, 8,154&frac14;; Cebu, 4,411&frac12;. All these are tributaries of
the crown; to these are added the contributions made by &ldquo;the
tributaries and the encomenderos of the encomiendas independent of the
royal crown,&rdquo; which amount to 18,144 gantas. A deduction must be
made from these of 1,105&frac34; gantas, &ldquo;from those who in the
number of the said tributes do not make this contribution, on account
of being servants of the churches, and for other reasons;&rdquo; the
result is the total above given. The tributaries of the following
provinces are exempted from the contribution: Balayan, Mindoro, Caraga,
Mariveles, Calamianes, and Cavite. A further source of revenue for the
expenses of Zamboanga is found in the monopoly on the wine of the
country; this had formerly belonged to the crown, but had been
surrendered at the petition of the city of Manila. Later, the citizens
being called upon to make donations for the support of Zamboanga, the
city petitioned that this be accomplished by renewing the above crown
monopoly of wine. &ldquo;This new monopoly having begun to be in force
from the year 1731, the sum at which this contribution [to Zamboanga]
may be estimated must be figured according to the successful bids
[<i lang="es">remates</i>] at which the privilege has been
leased;&rdquo; it was farmed out&mdash;that is, sold at auction to the
highest bidder for a term of three to five years. The first of these
was Don Esteban Garcia de los Rios, for 1731&ndash;33, for the sum of
10,000 pesos a year; the second, Captain Pedro de Ceballos, for
1734&ndash;36, 15,500 pesos a year; the third, Captain Jos&eacute;
Ruiz, for 1737&ndash;41, 25,000 pesos a year. The proceeds of this
monopoly, then, averaged during eleven years 16,833 pesos a year. This
document is dated at Manila, February 4, 1738.</p>
<p class="par footnote cont">In regard to the contributions made by the
Indians for the expenses (outside of ecclesiastical) of the Philippine
colonies, Torrubia says (<i lang="es">Dissertacion</i>, pp.
98&ndash;103): &ldquo;When the post of Samboangan was rebuilt in the
year 1755, it was the opinion of the very reverend Father Juan de
Bueras, provincial of the Society of Jesus, that the Indians of
Pintados, as those most interested in the maintenance of the fort,
should aid therein with a half-ganta of rice for each tribute. His
opinion was accepted, but with the enlargement of the contribution to
two gantas (which make one ganta of cleaned rice), and its extension to
all the islands, which amount is paid up to this day. I have understood
that this contribution amounts annually, on the average, to two
thousand five hundred pesos. During the fifty and more years when
Samboangan did not exist, it was paid just as when the fort was there,
notwithstanding that the cabildo opposed it; and the Indians paid,
without the motive for this imposition still remaining, at the least
estimate, more than one hundred and fifty thousand pesos. The Indians
are obliged to make other contributions. For the maintenance of the
soldiers, they furnish rice to his Majesty at two reals a caban, and
usually it is worth more; this is called the <i lang="es">compra</i>,
and forty or forty-five thousand cabans (or fanegas) of rice are levied
from them in <i lang="es">compra</i>, allotting it <i lang="la">pro
rata</i> according to what each Indian sows. For these cabans (or
fanegas) no more than two reals are paid, although that amount is worth
four reals, or more; and it is to be noted that in the suburbs of
Manila the price ordinarily does not go below three reals. The same
practice is current in the compras of wheat, although it is true that
in this the Indians seldom lose much. Besides this, the Indians do the
timber-cutting for the ships, and do not receive more than sixteen
reals a month, which they do not have even for their tools (which they
carry with them); they are soldiers, they row in the galleys, and they
are mariners, artillerists, calkers, and carpenters. And we know very
well that in these occupations they serve in the Ribera of Cavite
without pay, and likewise in the armadas, three, four, or five years,
only to obtain a situation in the ship which goes to Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a or Acapulco. Here [<i>i.e.</i>, in Madrid], without
considering these contributions, all the expenses [of the islands] are
summed up for the account of his Majesty.&rdquo; He goes on to say that
from the sum of expenses must also be deducted the voluntary
contributions of the citizens; also that these military expenses have
been unfairly laid at the door of the Zamboanga fort. The soldiers
there and in the forts at Ceb&uacute; and Iloilo are paid from the
situado contributed by the natives themselves; and the fleets which are
sent against the Moros, and the coastguard galleys at Zamboanga, are
not an expense caused by the fort there; &ldquo;even if they were, it
is a necessary one, under penalty of the Moros eating us
alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par footnote cont">Torrubia ends his <i lang=
"es">Dissertacion</i>, which is a plea for the maintenance of the fort
at Zamboanga, with a scheme for the formation of a fund&mdash;to be
formed by levying a small tax on each of the Christian Sangleys, and on
every &ldquo;tramp,&rdquo; whether Indian or mestizo&mdash;which shall
be regarded as an <i lang="es">obra pia</i>, and be placed in the
management of the Misericordia; its proceeds are to be used for the
support of the military posts and fleets which are maintained against
the Moros, for the support of missionaries in the Moro provinces, and
even for the extension of the gospel still further. This would relieve
the natives from the oppressive &ldquo;Zamboanga donation,&rdquo; the
citizens from the frequent contributions now expected from them by the
government, and the royal treasury from the heavy burden of supporting
the present list of armadas and forts; and the Moro pirates would be
easily held in check, and the interests of both the Spaniards and the
Indians protected.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<p class="par footnote cont">Zamboanga was selected as the site for the
fort in Moroland, &ldquo;because it was the indispensable landing-place
for the hostile people; because it deprived the Mindanaos of that port,
which was the most important one in their dominion, in which they built
their ships, and where they took refuge from an enemy; because it was
the most suitable place for our infantry; and because it was the
frontier of all the islands of Moroland, where those enemies landed,
recruited their forces, and repaired their vessels. It also was the
point of vantage for intimidating those kings, and depriving Mindanao
of half its power; and for facing (at three leguas distance) Basilan,
the people of which are so valiant, and subject to Jol&oacute;, so that
that king also is thus disarmed of half his forces. To this was added
the consideration that the post had Christian Indians as neighbors,
who, free from the extortions of the Moros, would aid in the conquest
[of those lands] and the extension of our power and of our faith, as
has been actually done.&rdquo; (Torrubia, pp. 45, 46.)&nbsp;<a class=

<i lang="es">F&aacute;brica</i> (Latin, Italian, and Spanish; French,
<i lang="fr">fabrique</i>): a technical term in church administrative
usage. The ordinary and common meaning is the material building or
edifice, which (technically) includes repairs, improvements, changes,
etc., as well as the necessary expense for caretakers of it, as
watchmen, beadles, sweepers, etc.; these people are paid from the funds
of the <i lang="es">f&aacute;brica</i>&mdash;which might be rendered as
&ldquo;building-fund,&rdquo; except that in ecclesiastical usage
<i lang="es">f&aacute;brica</i> usually presupposes that the building
it already reared, while the English phrase &ldquo;building-fund&rdquo;
includes the idea of constructing it. (Yet in Latin, Italian, and
Spanish the term <i lang="es">f&aacute;brica</i> is also used to
include money for the erection of the church edifice, in cases where it
has not yet been built; where it has been completed and paid for,
<i lang="es">f&aacute;brica</i> is restricted to the meaning first
given above, the &ldquo;keep&rdquo; of the building.)</p>
<p class="par footnote cont">Thus usually the term has a material sense
only; but sometimes (though not commonly) <i lang=
"es">f&aacute;brica</i> is taken, as in the present text, in a
spiritual sense, and implies the support or maintenance (<i lang=
"es">honoraria</i>) of the churchmen, the ministers attached to the
building, as well as the maintenance of divine worship, as required by
ritual. <i lang="es">F&aacute;brica</i> then refers to affairs of the
soul or spirit, the spiritual upbuilding or edifice of the faithful. By
extension, the same term is sometimes used to mean the board of
churchwardens who administer the property. In the Philippines the
church property (save that belonging to the religious corporations) was
in the hands of the bishop as sole trustee and administrator, a power
which he might delegate to his provisor or vicar. The distribution of
the fund mentioned in the text is unusual.&mdash;<span class="sc">Rev.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">[Chapter i relates &ldquo;the urgent reasons for
the present treatise; and the necessity for, and usefulness of, our
hospital order in Philipinas.&rdquo; In the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>last
paragraph of the chapter Maldonado says: &ldquo;These islands are in
need of physicians and surgeons, as well as of medicines; for excepting
the capital Manila and the port of Cabite&mdash;where we have
hospitals, and where the few secular persons who exercise the
profession [of medicine] can render assistance&mdash;the rest of the
provinces, and the many dependent towns, are supported by Providence
alone, being helped by herbs and other simples about which they have
been instructed by continual use. But, as this is so complicated a
matter, whenever the patient&rsquo;s constitution and the dose
disagree, or when other substances are added to make the latter more
effective, the very article which was regarded as a remedy usually
aggravates the sickness, and consequently there are continual deaths
among those who make mistakes. In this capital, although there are
apothecary shops, and practitioners who write prescriptions&mdash;whose
charity is taken for granted, so far as they can exercise it&mdash;the
crowd of patients who resort to them does not allow them to succor all,
and it results that there is a great number who are unprovided [with
medical aid]. Others, because their poverty cannot bear the cost of the
medicines, and who have no one from whom to obtain food, find their
only asylum in our hospitals&mdash;where, without any hesitation, all
are received; and, making a distinction in the respect paid to them, in
regard to the rank or character of various persons who have entered
these houses, in so far as our abilities extend, the institution has
succeeded in giving entire satisfaction. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>Although the royal
charity maintains here a hospital and chapel at enormous cost, it is
understood that this is only for officers, soldiers, seamen, and
Pampangos who have positions and render actual service; for the men
retired from service are excluded by this rule, except by special favor
of the superior government. On this account, our attention to our
duties brings us in contact with a variety of people&mdash;priests,
citizens, militiamen, retired officers, Indians, negroes, besides
foreigners who trade in these ports. [These constitute] a great throng
of patients, and convince us that if so important a charity were to
fail or be neglected many dead persons would, to our sorrow, be found
in the streets and <i lang="es">entresuelos</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6236src" href="#xd24e6236" name="xd24e6236src">2</a> (the
dwellings of the poor); and others, worn out by their afflictions,
would be suffering the pangs of their necessities. These are relieved,
in the present circumstances; but the permanency of the work demands
that the superiors to whom the matter belongs shall aid us with
laborers and encourage us with their support, obtaining from the
Catholic royal piety what they shall deem suitable for this
purpose.&rdquo;]</p>
<p class="par">[Chapter ii recounts the royal decrees for the aid of
the hospitals at Manila, dated in the years 1590&ndash;96; the
foundation (April 16, 1594) of the Misericordia brotherhood, and their
establishment of a hospital, which after 1596 opened its doors to all
who needed its aid; and the surrender of the royal hospital to their
care (January 8, 1598), at the instance of Governor Francisco
Tello&mdash;their labors <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href=
"#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>therein making evident the
difference between the work accomplished by pure charity and that done
by persons hired to do it; they also maintained Franciscan ministers
for attending to the spiritual needs of the sick. In the conflagration
of May 1, 1603, the royal hospital was utterly destroyed, &ldquo;with
the third part of the buildings of this city, a loss which amounted to
more than a million of pesos.&rdquo; Then are enumerated the losses and
calamities which rendered this loss more grievous to the colony, the
destructive earthquake of June 21, 1599, followed by lesser shocks and
disturbances until the following year of 1600; the loss of two
richly-laden galleons (1599), the &ldquo;Santa Margarita&rdquo; and
&ldquo;San Ger&oacute;nimo;&rdquo; the attack of Oliver van Noordt
(December, 1600); the wreck of the &ldquo;Santo Thomas&rdquo; (1601),
and of another galleon which was about to be launched at Panamao; the
return to port of the galleons despatched in 1602 and 1604; and the
revolt of the Chinese in May, 1603. A royal decree dated November 4,
1606, directed Acu&ntilde;a to make every effort to rebuild the royal
hospital; meanwhile the Misericordia were aiding the throngs of people
who, made destitute by the various disasters above mentioned, implored
their help, and they spent in these exercises of charity eighty
thousand pesos in five years. Another royal decree (February 10, 1617)
directed the Audiencia of Manila to place the hospitals there in charge
of the brethren of St. John of God, who were going thither for that
purpose; but the war with the Dutch and other hindrances prevented them
from carrying out this enterprise]</p>
<p class="par">[Chapter iii states that about the year 1611 two
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>brethren of this order, Fray Juan de Gamboa and
Fray Lucas de los Angeles, had arrived in Manila, desirous to found a
hospital; but that the authorities there discouraged their plan. Some
writer has stated that these brethren returned in 1621 and founded a
hospital for convalescents at Bagumbaya; but Maldonado regards this as
uncertain, and difficult to verify, although some circumstances would
indicate the probability that they made a second attempt to establish
their order at Manila. At various times requests were sent from Manila
for these hospitalers, and in chapter iv are related the arrangements
finally made by the superiors of the order in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a to
send laborers to the Philippines, which was accomplished in the spring
of 1641; these were Fray Andr&eacute;s de San Joseph (a priest) and
Fray Antonio de Santiago (a lay brother). The warrant given them and
other official documents connected with their going are reproduced in
full by Maldonado.]</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">[The brethren of St. John of God began their
labors at Cavite, in November of 1641. Corcuera provided lodgings for
them in the royal buildings, and the inhabitants contributed so
liberally that they were able to open a hospital of ten beds; but so
great was the number of applicants for its aid that in January
following, the hospital brethren asked for and received the surrender
(January 30) to their management of the royal hospital at Cavite, with
all its property and slaves&mdash;provided that within four years they
obtain the royal confirmation of this grant. An inventory of this
hospital and its equipment <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href=
"#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>is more curious than edifying:
&ldquo;The house which served as a hospital was of wood and piles,
covered with tiling that was old and in bad condition; for dispensary
[<i lang="es">botica</i>], it had a wooden framework containing various
gallipots, vials, and earthen jars. In the infirmary were sixteen
mattresses, ten pillows, twenty-seven sheets, two coverlets, and
fourteen blankets; and its larder contained eighty cabans of rice,
forty gantas of oil, fifteen arrobas of sugar, and four jars of
conserves. For divine worship it had a box for an altar, hardly fit
[for such use]; a chalice with its paten, without any ornament; a bell
of medium size, and two small ones. For its service, it had some
slaves, five men and seven women. As for revenues, it had three and a
half residence lots and two lots occupied by shops, which yielded
twenty-six pesos and [<i>word omitted?</i>] granos a month; also some
woodlands, and a grazing tract in Leyton, a place near the said port,
with several head of horses and cattle. The most important [of its
assets] were the deliveries made from the [royal] storehouses, for
these were permanent; they had been ordered when the said hospital was
in charge of the religious of our seraphic father St. Francis.&rdquo;
These supplies, as appears from the records of the treasury board of
Manila, had been furnished since January 12, 1619, at the request of
the Franciscans in charge of the Cavite hospital. They asked, for
immediate use, for &ldquo;a dozen blankets, a dozen cupping-glasses,
two syringes, two pairs of Castilian scissors, two clasp-knives, six
lancets, two scarifiers; some wool for mattresses; two books, one
entitled <i lang="es">De Medicina</i>, by the author Barrios, and the
other by Dioscorides; four arrobas <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167"
href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>of Castilian wine; a barrel
of raisins and almonds; and half an arroba of <i lang="es">rosado</i>
sugar.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6272src" href="#xd24e6272"
name="xd24e6272src">3</a> For regular annual supplies, they asked two
hundred fanegas of cleaned rice, as hitherto they had had no amount
allotted for the hospital; six hundred fowls, since they received only
little more than two hundred a year from those assigned them by his
Majesty in Balay&aacute;n; and three hundred pesos from the royal
treasury, to be spent for meat, sugar, flour, and eggs, drugs from
China, clothing for the slaves and servants, and other needs of the
hospital. All these were granted them, and paid regularly until the
hospital was placed in charge of the Order of St. John of God (1642);
&ldquo;from that time there was a gradual diminution, to such an extent
that, by another general conference of the treasury officials in 1657
the whole was reduced, so that by way of contribution [from the
government] only two hundred pesos should be given, in the articles
which should be required each year, and this [only] in the interval
until other provision should be made.&rdquo; At the time when Maldonado
wrote, all government aid had been taken away; moreover, in 1645 the
brethren had been obliged to vacate the royal buildings, in which they
had been conducting the Cavite hospital, and were incommodiously
quartered in some poor shops of the Sangleys; but in October of that
year the authorities granted them the use of an empty building
belonging to his Majesty; it was constructed of nipa and bamboo, and
had been occupied by some fishermen. The Cavite hospital was rebuilt
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>four times by the brethren of St. John:
&ldquo;the first time, by the reverend father Fray Francisco de
Magallanes, which lasted until the year 1682; the second, by the
reverend father Fray Marcos de Mesa, a priest of the order, which
lasted until the year 1699; the third, by the reverend father Fray Juan
de Alarc&ograve;n, a priest, which lasted until the year 1728; and
lastly, the one which is being built by the present superior, Fray
Antonio de Ar&ccedil;e. There is no doubt that this will be established
in so good order that it will be an improvement on the previous ones;
and meanwhile a house has been made ready, with sufficient space for
lodgings. This was given as a contribution by Captain Don Miguel
Cordero; and in it are maintained eight beds, and the corresponding
offices. The title of this hospital always was, and still is, that of
St. Joseph. All its receipts in the year hardly reach two hundred and
sixty pesos, a support so scanty that it is not necessary to emphasize
the straitened manner in which the religious who minister in it must
support themselves; the one who directs it has the appointment of
prior.&rdquo; The sick soldiers and seamen at Cavite are sent to the
royal hospital of Manila for treatment; if the money which they cost
there were handed over to the Cavite hospital it could take better care
of them than they now receive.]</p>

<p class="par first">[A little more than two years after founding the
Cavite hospital, the hospitalers undertook to open a hospital for
convalescents, where these could have the dieting, rest, and care
necessary for fully regaining their health after they were discharged
from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=

persons had before perished. Accordingly, they obtained from Governor
Corcuera permission (April 16, 1644) to erect or buy a house for this
purpose, to be situated on the Pasig River above Manila; but
circumstances afterward induced them to locate it at Bagumbaya, a
suburb south of the city, outside the walls&mdash;permission being
given for this by Faxardo in the following September. Here, as in other
places, Maldonado mentions this enterprise as a revival of the one
supposed to have been undertaken in 1621. It contained two wards, one
for men and one for women, in which twenty persons could be cared for.
This work was continued but a short time&mdash;partly for lack of
hospitalers, who had to devote their main energies to the hospital in
Manila; and partly because the Bagumbaya house had not sufficient
facilities for the entertainment of its inmates, who quickly grew tired
of remaining there and of the strict dieting necessary for their full
recovery, and went away&mdash;in the majority of cases, to die.]</p>

<p class="par first">[The religious of the order then devoted
themselves to the Cavite hospital, and to the one established by the
Misericordia in Manila, which that brotherhood placed in their charge
in March, 1650; they took possession of it on May 31 following. The
conditions of this transfer are given by Maldonado in full (pp.
86&ndash;93). The donation is full and irrevocable, including all the
property, servants, and incomes of the hospital. The hospitalers are
obliged to treat poor women who are ill, both Spaniards and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=

of the citizens, who in such cases are expected to make an offering to
the hospital of three pesos each&mdash;save that for slaves belonging
to the seminary of Santa Isabel and to the Misericordia this offering
shall not be made. The latter institution shall be regarded as the
patron of the hospital, and shall aid it every year with such
contribution as is in its power, for necessary expenses and the support
of the sick. The women who are inmates of Santa Isabel shall be treated
by the brethren of St. John, so far as possible in the seminary itself;
and the medicines needed for these patients shall be provided by the
Misericordia, to the extent of two hundred pesos a year in advance. The
officers of that confraternity may visit the hospital, and shall have
the right to notify the superior of the hospitalers of any deficiency
or neglect they may find therein. Any charitable person may erect a
church or additional ward or wards in connection with the institution,
and be regarded as a patron thereof; and such addition shall not be
under the control of the officers of the Misericordia. The hospital,
however, shall retain the name of that brotherhood, and alms or
contributions for its benefit shall be asked in its name. All property,
incomes, rights, and credentials of the institution shall be
surrendered to the brethren of St. John, who shall not be expected to
give account to the Misericordia of any contributions which they may
receive; that association shall also use all its influence with the
authorities to secure their aid and favor for the hospital in all ways,
and to defend it from any objections or difficulties which may arise
against it, particularly from the Franciscans, who formerly had been
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>connected with it. In case the hospital order
shall lose all its laborers in the islands, the Misericordia shall
administer the hospital until the provincial of St. John in Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a shall be able to send more of his brethren to Manila; and
provision is made for the final settlement of affairs between that
order and the Misericordia, in case they decide to sever the present
relations. The latter association shall pay at once to the order eight
hundred pesos in cash, for the necessary expenses and equipment of the
brethren in opening their hospital labors. All the documents regarding
this affair and other important transactions of the Order of St. John
are reproduced in full by Maldonado. On taking possession of the
hospital (May 31, 1656) the hospitalers equipped three wards, with
twelve beds in each, where men and women might be cared for separately,
and the Indians and Morenos apart from the Spaniards. A small church
was also erected, with lodgings for the religious of the order; these
buildings were injured in the earthquake of July 19, 1664, but were
repaired for use until new ones could be erected. A new and large
church was built, but this also was wrecked by an earthquake in 1674; a
new church and convent were then built, which lasted until 1727, when
they were found to be in so bad condition from the repeated seismic
shocks which they had undergone that they must be reconstructed. This
was accordingly done, the new edifice being dedicated on May 10, 1732
(see chapters ix and x for full description of it). This was the
building which was standing at the time of Maldonado&rsquo;s writing,
and it had three wards, each containing more than twenty beds; that for
the women is especially praised for its comfort <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>and
convenience. &ldquo;During these last twelve years&rdquo;
[Zaragoza&rsquo;s approbation states that the book was written in 1739]
&ldquo;there have been admitted sixteen priests, secular clergy, one
religious of our father St. Dominic, two other religious of our
seraphic father St. Francis, seventy-six students from the four
colleges which are in this city; and from the laity, the licentiate Don
Juan Francisco de Velasco, auditor of this royal Audiencia, and a large
number of citizens&mdash;not to mention eight thousand poor persons of
inferior condition and rank. This appears from the books of
registration, from which this enumeration has been made. Attention was
given to all these patients, in accordance with their respective
stations; and with the same consideration burial was given to those who
died.&rdquo;]</p>

right and title of patronage which was reserved to the Misericordia in
the foregoing agreement; and certain individual members of that
association, &ldquo;moved (as it is inferred) by pious although very
indiscreet zeal,&rdquo; stirred up these doubts and made officious
inquiries. Although they did no harm, it was thought best to consult
the heads of the Jesuit university in regard to the objections thus
raised; and their opinion (undated) is given by Maldonado. Those
learned professors declared in favor of the hospitalers, saying that
any official visitation and inspection of their work could be made only
by the archbishop of the islands; the officers of the Misericordia
might visit the hospital, but could not, even as its patrons, exercise
any legal authority or compulsion <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173"

a stipulation in the original document transferring the hospital (chap,
vii); they also remind the Misericordia of the wretched condition in
which the hospital was when that association gave it up&mdash;for this
purpose citing the inventory made at that time of the property thus
transferred. Some curious particulars are found therein. The old
hospital had but one ward, under which was &ldquo;the old chapel, where
the dead were buried.&rdquo; One of the items is, &ldquo;Twelve head of
slaves, most of them more than fifty years old, and some past
sixty.&rdquo; Its equipment of bedding, etc., comprises &ldquo;four old
tents of medri&ntilde;aque; seven mattresses, made of Ilocos blankets,
with their outside badly worn; ten pillows, with their covers of
medri&ntilde;aque, old; two tables, with tablecovers, with six napkins,
old; twelve sheets of Ilocos weave.&rdquo; Various articles for the use
or adornment of the altar in the church are listed, most of them
characterized as &ldquo;old;&rdquo; while an image of St. Joseph and
the Holy Child is &ldquo;old and battered.&rdquo; There are &ldquo;nine
old cots for beds;&rdquo; &ldquo;a large chest, old, without any
key;&rdquo; &ldquo;an old wooden table, on which the food is
distributed;&rdquo; &ldquo;two old chairs for seats;&rdquo; &ldquo;four
large cots, for Spanish women;&rdquo; &ldquo;two old books which treat
of medicine&rdquo; (evidently those asked for by the Franciscans in
1619); &ldquo;one hundred and twelve porcelain vials, empty;&rdquo;
&ldquo;sixty-one gallipots of Chinese porcelain, empty;&rdquo;
&ldquo;two stone kitchen mortars, without handles;&rdquo; and some few
other articles suitable for hospital use, that are presumably in good
condition. In view of these facts, there is no ground for bringing
complaints against <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174"
name="pb174">174</a>]</span>the brethren of St. John, especially since
they were not obliged by the document of donation to conform to any
given standard in their management of the hospital, nor was any
provision made therein for summoning them to give account thereof to
the ordinary. The labors of conducting the hospital and providing means
for its support are quite arduous enough for the order, without
imposing upon it the burden of keeping accounts of all the receipts and
expenses&mdash;a charge which it probably would not have accepted, and
which cannot be now imposed upon it. The income of the institution from
the property surrendered with it&mdash;a legacy from the late Captain
Nicolas de Luzurriaga&mdash;does not exceed a thousand pesos, which is
a very inadequate endowment for meeting all the expenses which must be
incurred for the patients sent to the hospital by the Misericordia,
even if these number no more than eight; and its scantiness prevents
that association from making any just claim to the exercise of
authority over the hospital. Indeed, the Jesuits censure the
Misericordia for having done so little for the institution since they
surrendered it to the brethren of St. John. Further: &ldquo;Apparently
the mistake of the Board [of the Misericordia] consists in their being
surprised that the sick are not better treated or regaled in the said
hospital, when they see that the Order of St. John of God has an
encomienda granted by his Majesty the king (whom may God preserve), a
ranch of cattle and cultivated lands, some lots occupied by shops in
the Parian outside the walls of Manila, and other considerable
revenues&mdash;which, as evidently appears, are all considered as
possessions of the said hospital of the Misericordia, of which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>they are patrons&mdash;[a mistake which arises]
from seeing that all these are possessed by the religious of St. John
of God, but not making a distinction in regard to what belongs to that
order as an order, for the support of its brethren. Such is the ranch;
when, in the year 49, Captain Don Pedro Gomez Ca&ntilde;ete lay sick in
the hospital for convalescents at Bagumbaya, without the walls of this
city, he made a donation, by a clause of his last will and testament,
of the said farms to the said religious order. Suit having been brought
by Captain Geronimo Fuentes for a sum of money which the said Captain
Don Pedro Gomez Ca&ntilde;ete owed, the aforesaid properties were
placed at public auction, and the said religious order secured in the
said auction, for a bid of 12,100 pesos, the said ranch and some shops
in the Parian&mdash;nineteen of them upper, and twenty lower; and eight
other shops for the peddlers, with their lodging-rooms above. The said
order also obtained at public auction eight residence lots in the
locality of La Hermita and Santiago de Bagumbaya (which were the ones
where they started their work), and some others which they bought. The
site and locality where the church and convent of the said order are at
present built were the houses which belonged to Captain Don Alonso
Parrilla; these also were secured at auction, for the price of 3,000
pesos, by paying in cash (as it did) 2,650 pesos, and the remainder of
the 3,000 was left in a mortgage that could be paid up, the said order
paying the amount due every year to this same Board of the holy
Misericordia. Another [resource is] a chaplaincy of masses to the Holy
Ghost and the Conception, which was founded by Do&ntilde;a Hypolita de
Zarate y Osseguerra. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176"
name="pb176">176</a>]</span>These incomes have nothing to do with the
hospital as a hospital; and therefore, in accordance with this, the
members of the Board cannot require that these revenues be subjected to
official investigation, any more than in the case of other
contributions and incomes which other benefactors had left to the said
hospital, even though the proceeds of these are handled, and
surrendered to the said religious, by this same Misericordia as
administrators for the said benefactors; for the members of the Board
have no rights as patrons over any of these, as is clearly stated in
the agreement made in the conditions of donation.&rdquo; &ldquo;From
all this, the fathers rector and masters of this university of the
Society of Jesus conclude that only with the gravest scruples of
conscience, and at the risk of defaming the said religious order by
accusations of omission or negligence in fulfilling their obligation to
render assistance to the said sick persons, can the members of the
Board on this pretext demand before the illustrious archbishop that the
said religious be visited, and account be demanded from them of the
expenses and receipts, and of other matters pertaining to the said
assistance&mdash;not only in regard to all the incomes which the
hospital order, as such, possesses, noting down the contributions from
all the benefactors of it; but as little even the proceeds which by the
said donation the religious received from this same brotherhood of the
holy Misericordia&mdash;since that is expressly contrary to the
agreement made with the said religious order in the instrument of
donation, and would be a very heavy and onerous new burden upon it, if
imposed now, after sixty years, on a donation which was originally
free, complete, and irrevocable.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

the solemn functions annually celebrated therein, instances of

during eight days. On the last day an oration was delivered by the
Dominican Fray Juan de Arrechedera, who is styled by our writer
&ldquo;the Tullius of Manila.&rdquo; The church measured one hundred

<p class="par">[In chapter xi occurs a curious digression in the midst
of the descriptions of the solemn functions solemnized in the hospital
church; enumeration of the instances of miraculous aid afforded by the
Virgin to her devotees gives occasion for an account of the system of
weights used by the Chinese traders in the islands, and the change made
from these to the Castilian system. General Joseph Antonio Nu&ntilde;o
de Villavicencio &ldquo;also relates that commission had been given to
him to abolish the use of a certain make of steelyards [<i lang=
"es">pesadores</i>] customary with the Chinese and other foreigners,
with which commerce had been carried on in this city from the earliest
times; and to establish [a system of] weights and measures modeled on
the Castilian, according to the provisions of the laws of both
kingdoms. He recognized that the serious nature of this charge demanded
the most extraordinary exertions, or else that the hindrances should be
removed which had hindered it from being effective on occasions when,
at various times, the [same] attempt had been made. But, being also
stimulated by his own reputation, in order not to be conquered by the
difficulty without a previous investigation, and being incited to close
application by his interest in a transaction as much to the service of
his Majesty as to the general welfare of the commonwealth, he proceeded
to the consideration of the importance of this business (the serious
inconveniences of which might defeat his efforts), and of the risk
incurred for his reputation if, after he had accepted the commission,
he could not fulfil it; and the more he thought about it, the less did
he unravel the tangle. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href=
"#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>At last, in his anxiety he found
no recourse more certain of success than to offer himself to the divine
favor [as expressed] in that sovereign object, the holy image [of the
Virgin]; and in this confidence he carried on the enterprise, heedless
of any risk, and succeeded in his object, to the satisfaction of the
many who before were disparaging it as chimerical, or who regarded it
as impracticable. He gained the approbation of the royal Audiencia so
thoroughly that it conferred upon him new powers for [introducing] the
same arrangement in all the provinces of its jurisdiction in these
islands, where the same injurious effect was experienced; and he
executed this commission with exactness, sending [to all places]
carefully regulated models and instructions for making it
effective.&rdquo; Maldonado then goes on to describe the mode of weight
formerly in vogue among the Chinese traders, as well as the Castilian
system, thus:]</p>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="xd24e6344">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><i>Form of the Chinese balances</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Let me be the first to explain the construction of
the Chinese balances which were in use; they were called
<i>da-Chens</i>. In shape it resembled a steelyard [<i>romana</i>]; the
yard or beam was made of a kind of wood which they call <i lang=
"es">palma brava</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6359src" href=
"#xd24e6359" name="xd24e6359src">5</a> and in its form was like a mace
for playing truck [<i lang="es">trucos</i>]&mdash;except the butt,
which at the extremity was thicker. It had a sort of frame of copper,
octagonal in shape, with its movable pointer in the middle [<i lang=
"es">con su espiga en medio de movimiento</i>], and some pendent hooks.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>For indicating the weights, there were certain
points marked by nails, set at proportionate distances, but without any
numbers or any other characters to show the weight definitely. For
counterweight there was a piece of metal or of stone hanging by a cord,
but without any sign or mark by which the dachen or balance could make
known what was entrusted to it.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6382src"
href="#xd24e6382" name="xd24e6382src">6</a> To this badly-constructed
instrument the handling of all kinds of merchandise had been reduced,
and the trade was carried on [by it] among Spaniards, Chinese, Indians,
and Morenos; and through necessity they&mdash;even the superiors and
prelates&mdash;employed this balance on all occasions that arose, from
the earliest times of the conquest until the year 1727, when the
measure that is here discussed was carried into effect. This was not
because the project had not been brought forward repeatedly, and at
various times, but because the difficulties which hindered it could not
be obviated. But, to continue the subject, so well known was the
uncertainty of those dachens that even the very Chinese, although it
originated in their own country, stipulated beforehand for every
transaction the balance by which [the goods] must be received or
delivered; for each one of them regarded the balance which he himself
used as the better reckoner. There were small ones, for weighing gold
and silver; and others that were larger, for bulky goods. The weights
by the smaller ones were computed in taels, each one corresponding to
twenty adarmes of our Castilian weight. From the tael <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>there was a diminution down to granos, of which
six were worth one adarme; but these names were never common in our
language.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6390src" href="#xd24e6390" name=
"xd24e6390src">7</a> The chief weight consisted of <i lang=
"es">cates</i>, each about twenty-two onzas; the <i lang=
"es">chinanta</i>, which was equivalent to about ten cates, and in our
Castilian weight to thirteen libras and twelve onzas; the
<i>quintal</i>, which was worth about eight chinantas, or eighty cates,
and corresponded to about one hundred and ten libras of our weight; and
the largest was called <i>pico</i>, which was reckoned at ten
chinantas, or one hundred cates, and in our weight five and a half
arrobas. But as this correspondence of weight to weight was prevented
as people understood more thoroughly the lack of accuracy in the said
balances, and the [cause for] suspicion of the way in which they were
managed by the Chinese&mdash;a people of such cunning that in their own
land fraud is a science, in which degrees are given&mdash;the Spaniards
found themselves compelled to depend on computing the equivalent [in
Castilian weight], according to the greater or less skill of each
person [in reckoning]; but the ignorance of the Indians and the common
people, exposed [as they were] to the insatiable greed, lack of piety,
and unscrupulousness of the said Sangleys, who gained great profits
from this practice, aided the subtlety of the latter.</p>

<h4 class="main"><i>Difficulties which arose in regard to the
introduction of new weights</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">This fact being established, from it follows the
reason of the difficulty, which is the subject (and to this end the
considerations) on which argument arises. In order to suppress the use
of the said dachens, it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href=
"#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>was necessary to have in reserve
other weighing instruments, with which the commerce, both wholesale and
retail, could be regulated. In order to establish the Castilian
weights, there must be specimens of the original standards which had to
be followed, according to the royal decrees, to which weights must be
conformed; and a factory must be established for the number of
instruments which the new order of things would require. There was an
absolute lack of everything; and therefore it was necessary either to
permit the use of the dachens, or to make a general prohibition of
commerce in the commodities for which the said balances served. To
adopt any expedient less onerous was not allowed in the commission;
that the former [<i>i.e.</i>, the use of the Chinese weights] should be
continued was the very thing which he [<i>i.e.</i>, General
Villavicencio] was ordered to prevent; to deny trade to the people
would be ridiculous and ineffectual. The custom was as old as the
Spanish occupancy of the country; the serious danger of disturbances,
[if he undertook] to regulate steelyards by guess, without observing
the exactness [required by] the laws, was a new difficulty; delay
[would be ir]remediable, and the general injury irreparable! Let the
most discreet person, then, infer from these circumstances whether the
undertaking was an arduous one, whether the least [in]advertence would
be conspicuous, and [what were] the risks to his reputation for good
judgment; and whether recourse to sovereign aid would be urgent for his
success....</p>

<h4 class="main"><i>Castilian weight</i></h4>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The reckoning of our Castilian marco in accordance
with the laws which prescribe its form originates <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>with
grains of wheat. The weight of thirty-six grains is computed as an
adarme; sixteen of these make one onza, and sixteen onzas one libra;
twenty-five libras make one arroba, and four arrobas the greatest
weight, which is a quintal. Laying aside the declarations that wheat
may not be used to supplement the established weights of metal (a
custom of various ports and provinces), it appears that, with only this
information, a corresponding standard could not be made in Manila,
since it was deficient in that species of wheat to which the laws
refer<span class="corr" id="xd24e6428" title="Source: ;">,</span> and
although there is likewise a harvest of these grains in Philipinas, and
quantities of wheat are also brought hither from China&mdash;some
[having grains] of larger size and less weight, and others that are
small and compact&mdash;the variety in them arouses great uncertainty,
for a matter so delicate. Certain it is that, whatever might be taken
for the origin [of this computation], it must produce a system
corresponding [to the Castilian]; and, by being made general for both
buying and selling goods, it would furnish due fulfilment to the form
prescribed in the respective laws. But, as that system would always be
deemed more conformable to the intention of the laws the more [nearly]
its ratios were identical [with those of Castilla], and when the
variety of weights and measures (which, considering the laborious
nature of mercantile operations and the interests at stake in them, is
at times a very onerous burden) in the provinces with which trade is
carried on should be reduced to a common basis: as these islands
possess the trade with Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, the importance which any
unforeseen disagreement might indicate could not be overlooked. This
consideration led to the most careful <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb186" href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>investigation of the
basis to which the matter could be reduced; and, in order to find the
system equivalent [to that of Castilla], various standards were
adjusted to one another, from which a safe conclusion might be drawn.
Accordingly, grains of lentils (which give name to the marco<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e6433src" href="#xd24e6433" name="xd24e6433src">8</a>
of Aragon) were taken, and search was made for grains of wheat whose
weight would correspond, with the difference of one-eighth. The same
was done with grains of <i lang="es">alberjones</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd24e6438src" href="#xd24e6438" name="xd24e6438src">9</a> (from
which sort originated the marco of Venecia), and it was found that the
weight of each one agreed with that of four grains of separated wheat.
The same was done with chick-peas [<i lang="es">garvanzos</i>] (from
which the marco of Flandes took its origin), and it was found that one
of these weighed the same as thirty-six grains of wheat. As a result,
through the weight of the aforesaid legumes, in the respective ratios
of the marcos of Aragon, Venecia, and Flandez, and the corresponding
weight of the grains of wheat, to which reference is made by our
Castilian marco, sufficient basis was formed on which to make the
standards [of weight]. In fact, they were made by this rule, weights of
metal being made which should correspond to one, two, and three grains
of wheat, and which together should weigh as much as the weight which
is called a grano of silver; another of one, two, and three granos of
this sort, the aggregate of which should be equivalent to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>weight of one adarme; and by this [were
established] the rest of the weights corresponding [to those of
Castilla], as far as that one which would contain one onza, from which
resulted the greater weights of libras and arrobas. Metal weights were
also made equivalent to half a grain of wheat, and to one-fourth,
one-eighth, one-sixteenth, and one-thirty-second of a grain, which last
is the same as the eleven hundred and fifty-second part of the adarme;
or, if this latter weight were divided into so many and small parts,
each one of them would alike agree with the weight made for the
thirty-second part of the grain of wheat.</p>

construction of the weighing instrument which serves as standard in
this capital, and is kept in the archives in the building of the
municipal cabildo; it is a work which for its elegance might be valued
in any one of the principal cities of Espa&ntilde;a and of the Indias.
It is a small one, such as is required by the weights which it carries;

<p class="par first">[That which had been] the physical probability of
conformity of this construction [with the standard of Castilla] was
rendered certain with remarkable exactness. Commission was given by the
cabildo of this city that twenty-five steelyards should be sent from
the kingdom of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a; and, these having been brought
hither at the time when the aforesaid steelyards and the weights, both
large and small, were already made, [the cabildo] proceeded to make the
comparison [between these and those] with judicial solemnity and the
assistance of experts. This transaction having been completed with the
exactness which its importance rendered urgent, the two sets of
steelyards were found to agree so closely that it appeared that in
those sent from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a the scales were balanced by the
weights made in Manila, or that these were the regular weights for the
said steelyards!... This measure, be it worthy of record, began with
the benefit to the common people of these islands in the
suppression<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6478src" href="#xd24e6478" name=

easy and continual fraud therein was computed by an official
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>as being, in the limits of Manila alone, more
than thirty thousand pesos a year&mdash;an evil so deeply rooted that
few persons supposed that it could be remedied. So far did this go that
the Marqu&egrave;s de Torre-Campo, then governor of these islands
(whose prudent moderation was always honored), at the time when
permission was asked from him for the publication of the proclamation
by which the new usage was established and the old one prohibited, made
very sententious remarks expressing his opinion that the said effort
would be useless on account of the difficulties which, he inferred,
would obstruct its effectiveness. But experience proved that he was
mistaken; for in twenty-four hours [from that time] it would have been
difficult to find any Chinese steelyard, if search had been made. It
appears from the original acts&mdash;and these have been furnished to
us for this relation, which in everything punctually follows and refers
to them&mdash;that before reaching this last step, the publication of
the prohibition of Chinese weights, the authorities caused to be made
as large a number of properly regulated steelyards as the shops and
guilds which use them might reasonably be expected to need. Then the
Chinese were notified that the da-chens which they used should be
brought forward; these were retained [by the authorities], and
Castilian steelyards were given [in place of them], with printed
instructions for observance by those who used them; and steelyards for
the use of the public were set in various places, with trustworthy
persons [in charge], who could instruct persons of little
understanding. And it is generally known that, although this was a
matter of so serious tendency, and included every class of persons, not
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>slightest disturbance arose; for all knew its
importance, and in order to enjoy the convenience [of the new weights]
submitted to learn the first rudiments of knowledge [about them]; and
perplexity [on this point] lasted but a short time, or was not evident
at all, for in matters which concern one&rsquo;s interests close
application makes progress, even in the dullest persons.</p>

Greg&oacute;rio Padilla y Escalante, who lived in the village of
Binondo. A sad tragedy is hinted at in the record, although it is
mentioned chiefly in connection with ecclesiastical quarrels over
parish dues and the disputed right of interring the poor corpse. On
January 26, 1736, a Spanish girl of about fifteen years was brought to
the hospital; she had been found stretched on the ground near the door
of the seminary church of Santa Isabel, bruised and senseless, and died
in about an hour, without recovering consciousness. No one knew who she
was; but her body was placed near the door of the hospital church, to
see if any person would recognize it. Several identified it as that of
Do&ntilde;a Josepha de Leon, a pupil in the said seminary, who in a
temporary insanity had flung herself from the roof of that building to
the street below.] <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191"

<p class="par first">[This chapter is devoted to an account of the
government of the province of the Order of St. John; a list of its
provincials, with their terms of office; and a list of all the members
of the order therein, at the time of writing this history. This
province had always been subject to the very reverend
commissary-general of the order resident in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a; and,
as its funds did not permit it to bring men from Europe, the superior
at Manila would admit novices who wished to engage in the work of the
order. These, when sufficiently instructed, if they showed a true
vocation for that work were received into the order, and thus its
numbers were sufficiently recruited to sustain its labors. The choice
of a provincial for the islands was always reserved to the said
commissary at Mexico, who usually reappointed the same man, when he had
been found competent for that office; this appointee was regarded as
the vicar and visitor for the commissary (except in the matter of
authority to grant dismissory letters to members of the order), and
those titles were bestowed on the prior of the Manila convent (the
principal house), regarded to all intents and purposes as provincial,
but with the modest title of &ldquo;superior&rdquo; [<i lang=
"es">prelado</i>]. The province had four houses: those at Cabite and
Manila, and two others, at Bagumbaya and Zeb&ugrave; respectively. When
Maldonado wrote, the two former alone remained. The prior at Cabite was
nominally appointed by the commissary at Mexico; but the uncertainties,
delays, and costs caused by the distance thither and the long and
dangerous voyage rendered it necessary to leave this choice practically
in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>hands of the superior at Manila. The brethren of
the community met every three years to elect councilors and transact
other business. The superior appointed a procurator-general, manager of
the hospital, and other minor officials. Besides the priests and
brethren of the order, certain men called <i lang="es">donados</i> were
admitted to its ranks for the service of the poor and for the commoner
duties of the convent. In the month of November of each year, the
officers of the Misericordia visited the hospital officially&mdash;it
being definitely understood that they had no right to meddle with its
management in any way. On New Year&rsquo;s day of each year, the
community assembled and chose by lot a patron saint for the coming
year.]</p>
<p class="par">[Following is the list of superiors (not counting Fray
Juan de Gamboa, who came in 1621, because his attempt to establish the
order proved abortive): (1) Father Fray Andr&egrave;s de San Joseph, a
native of Mexico; his patent was dated February 20, 1641 and he ruled
the province until August 3, 1643. (2) Father Fray Francisco
Magallanes, a Portuguese; he received his credentials on March 10,
1643, but did not go to the islands that year; he took possession on
August 3, 1644, and held the office until August 4, 1662. (3) Father
Fray Francisco Cardoso, a Portuguese; he immediately succeeded
Magallanes (by whom he was appointed, under special authority conferred
by the commissary), and held the office for four years. (4) Father Fray
Christoval Nieto de Salazar, a native of Mexico; he ruled from
September 4, 1666 until August 9, 1669. (5) Father Fray Marcos de Mesa,
a native of Tescuco, Mexico, held office from August 9, 1669 until
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>his death in 1682. (6) Father Fray Luis de la
Cruz, a Canari by birth, next held the office, from 1682 until his
death on January 25, 1683; he came to Manila as alternate for the
regular appointee, Fray Fructuoso de Texada (who died three days after
he reached the port of Cavite); opposition to his rule arose in the
order itself, but he was finally placed in possession of the office by
the provisor of the archdiocese, aided by military force. (7) Father
Fray Phelipe de Jesus, a native of Manila, was superior from January
25, 1683 until September 2, 1684. (8) Father Fray Antonio de Robles, a
native of Mexico, ruled from September 2, 1684 until 1687; he then went
to Zeb&ugrave;, and was ordained a secular priest (9) Father Fray
Phelipe de Jesus, as chief councilor, took the place of Fray Robles,
and held office for three years. (10) Father Fray Domingo de Santa
Maria, a Vizcayan, governed the province from July 16, 1690 until 1692,
when he also entered the secular priesthood. (11) For the third time,
Fray Phelipe de Jesus held the office of superior, this time from July
21, 1692 until July 8, 1694. (12) Father Fray Manuel de San
Rom&agrave;n then took his place, ruling until August 13, 1697. (13)
Father Fray Francisco Beltr&agrave;n, a native of Manila; as chief
councilor, he took the place of Fray Phelipe de Jesus, who died after
having been appointed superior by the commissary; Beltr&agrave;n held
the office only one year. (14) Father Fray Geronimo Nadales, a native
of Habana, was sent over by the commissary, and ruled from August 28,
1698 until his death, January 20, 1703. (15) Father Fray Ignacio Gil de
Arevalo, a native of Mexico; as chief councilor, he took
Nadales&rsquo;s place, which he filled until his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>death in 1706. (16) Father Fray Francisco
Hurtado, a native of Mexico; he was second in the council, and became
superior through election by the community after the death of Fray Gil;
much opposition arose from a disaffected faction, but Hurtado held the
office (although with some subsequent limitations of authority) from
1706 until August 11, 1708. (17) Father Fray Juan de Santacruz, a
native of Manila, was superior during the next three years. (18) Father
Fray Francisco Hurtado secured the commissary&rsquo;s nomination, and
held the office from August 11, 1711 to July 13, 1720; &ldquo;in his
time there was a notable decline in this province.&rdquo; (19) Father
Fray Santiago Gutierrez, a native of Manila, ruled from July 13, 1720
to August 12, 1724; he was then deposed and secluded by the
archdiocesan ordinary: Maldonado regrets the injury thus inflicted on
the order and its privileges, but discreetly refrains from open censure
of this proceeding. (20) Father Fray Lucas de San Joseph, a native of
Manila; he was prior of Cabite, and took the place of Fray Gutierrez;
he entered the office on August 19, 1724, and ruled only two months,
being requested to resign, as a result of various discords among the
brethren. (21) Father Fray Eugenio Antonio del Ni&ntilde;o Jesus, a
native of La Puebla, Mexico; he was chosen by the community, in place
of Fray San Joseph, and held office from October 3, 1724 until June 17,
1726. He restrained the discontent and disputes which were rife in the
order, and his firmness and good management prevented what would have
been great disasters to the province. (22) Fray Antonio de Arce, a
native of Mexico City (the superior at the time when Maldonado wrote);
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>he was sent by the commissary with additional
powers, assumed his office on June 17, 1726, and completed the good
work begun by his predecessor; he restored harmony in the province,
replaced the dilapidated buildings with new ones, and secured for his
order the respect and prestige which it had largely lost under
inefficient superiors. Maldonado eulogizes Fray Arce&rsquo;s abilities,
energy, and good judgment&mdash;qualities which have advanced the order
in Manila to equality with the others there.]</p>
<p class="par">[Our writer enumerates the minor officials of the order
at the time of his writing. There are three chaplains and preachers:
father Fray Marcos Beltr&agrave;n (who made his profession in 1740), a
native of Cabite; father Fray Juan Manuel Maldonado de Puga, a native
of Quautla, Mexico, who came to the islands in 1727; and father Fray
Raphael Fernandez (professed in 1732), a native of Manila. The two
councilors are father Fray Santiago Gutierrez (professed in 1700), a
native of Manila; and father Fray Joseph Hidalgo (professed in 1732), a
native of Mexico. The hospital is in charge of father Fray Joseph
Guerrero, a native of Chalco, Mexico, who came to the islands in 1726.
The procurator-general is father Fray Joseph Mariano (professed in
1722), a native of Manila; and the chief sacristan is father Fray

<p class="par">[Maldonado makes special mention of a few distinguished
members of the order in Manila, who have flourished in recent years;
regarding others, he states that he lacks information. Father Fray
Marzelo del Arroyo, a native of Manila, entered the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>order at Cabite, and died at Manila, past the
age of ninety years; he was &ldquo;an excellent physician, and a strong
defender of the privileges of the regulars;&rdquo; and he filled with
distinction all the offices of the order except that of superior.
Father Fray Francisco Alabes, a native of the city of Oaxaca, Mexico,
was the first who took the habit of St. John (1647) in these islands;
he rendered excellent service in the Cabite hospital, and assisted
Father Magallanes in founding the one at Bagumbaya. Father Fray Juan de
Alarc&ograve;n had many gifts; he was a noted orator, who was called
&ldquo;Golden Mouth,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6538src" href=
"#xd24e6538" name="xd24e6538src">12</a> a famous poet, and a zealous
defender of the order; for a long time he was physician for the entire
city, and administrator of the convent at Cabite and of the ranch of
San Juan de Buenavista, belonging to the order; he died at an advanced
age. Father Fray Bernardo Xavier, a native of La Puebla in Mexico; he
had held the chair of theology in the Jesuit university in Manila, and
his brethren there called him &ldquo;a sun eclipsed;&rdquo; in
disposition retiring, humble, austere, devout, and charitable, he was
attracted to the labors of the brethren of St. John, and entered their
ranks on November 25, 1671; he died on August 14, 1720. Three religious
of this order were slain by the natives: Fray Antonio de Santiago,
manager of the ranch, slain by the savage Negritos (probably before
1650); Fray Lorenzo Gomez, killed while traveling in Ilocos by the
savage Tinguianes of the mountains; Fray Juan Antonio Guemez, killed
with lances by the native bandits &ldquo;who infested our estate of
Buenavista.&rdquo; Maldonado suggests that some member of the order act
as recorder of its annals and labors, so <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

and cavaller&iacute;as<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6556src" href=
"#xd24e6556" name="xd24e6556src">13</a> of lands belonged to us in an
estate called Buenavista, Pinaot, and Bolo, in the jurisdiction of
Bulacan, provinces close to Manila. But as the donor when he died left
debts behind, the lands were appraised, with preference of the legacies
to the debts of justice;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6568src" href=
"#xd24e6568" name="xd24e6568src">14</a> and the said property being
placed at royal auction, with the offerings of other benefactors, the
highest bid was made on the part of our order, in the sum of twelve
thousand one hundred pesos. Afterward other lands were added to this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>estate, by donations and purchases which were
made, and questions arose over the boundaries; but, as we have for our
defense the just titles, the crown<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6576src"
href="#xd24e6576" name="xd24e6576src">15</a> has maintained us in the
legitimate possession of the lands, which is evident from the records
and decisions, which are here set down <i lang="la">verbatim</i>, and
which declare it.&rdquo; Here follow the documents which show that
Ca&ntilde;ete received a grant, April 4, 1629, of two farm-sites and
three cavaller&iacute;as of land in the village of San Miguel, the
former part of the grant being opposed by the Indians of Candaba;
another was made to Gonzalo Ronquillo Ballesteros, September 26, 1601,
of &ldquo;two farms for horned cattle, and four cavaller&iacute;as of
land, in the district of Alatib, toward Candaba, close to
Canagoan;&rdquo; and the boundaries were settled by acts of the
Audiencia, March 2 and May 14, 1715. &ldquo;These said lands, those
which were likewise obtained by the accountant Pedro de Almansa, and
others which belonged to the monastery of Santa Clara, were sold to the
aforesaid Don Pedro Gomez Ca&ntilde;ete, and are among those which were
purchased, as was related in the beginning [of this book]; and
afterward were added to it other lots of land, all which compose the
estate of Buenavista, which belongs to our order in these
islands.&rdquo; In 1715 the hospital brethren complained that the
Augustinians had intruded upon their lands, and were even building a
house thereon, paying no heed to the repeated remonstrances of the
superior of St. John; but the acts above cited confirmed the order in
its possession of the lands, and ordered the Augustinians to cease work
on their house and give account <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201"
href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>of their procedure. &ldquo;In
this estate there are arable lands, pastures for the many cattle with
which it is stocked, fruit-trees, and woodlands where the trees are cut
for lumber. It was always maintained with one religious, who, as
administrator, had charge of its produce; but when an opportunity to
rent it occurred, it was considered best, and even more profitable, to
do so. For it we receive five hundred pesos, and three hundred cabans
of rice, annually for the period of five years, which is the present
agreement, and it is well guaranteed.&rdquo;]</p>
<p class="par"><i>Irrigated lands in the district of Polo.</i>&mdash;By
a donation which Fray Thomas Ortiz, one of our religious, made to this
convent&mdash;it belonged to the lawful share which he inherited from
his parents&mdash;we possess certain irrigated lands<a class="noteref"

place which is called Col&ograve;n, within the limits of the village of
Polo, in the province of Bulac&agrave;n. The co-heirs brought suit in
regard to these lands; but this, when tried in the courts, was declared
in our favor. The said lands yield forty pesos as yearly rent.</p>

various places, from the village of La Hermita to that of Bagumbaya;
these pay in land-rents eighteen pesos a year. In this land is included
the original site on which was located the hospital for convalescents,
which was founded by the first religious [of our order] who came to
these islands, as is elsewhere related.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Properties in the Pari&agrave;n.</i>&mdash;In the
Alcayzer&igrave;a, the Pari&agrave;n of the Sangleys, outside the
walls, were purchased two properties, on which there are forty-seven
shops and upper lodgings; these, when occupied, yield ninety-seven
pesos a month, which amounts through the year to one thousand one
hundred and sixty-four pesos.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Lots in Manila.</i>&mdash;For two houses, and two
lots besides, which belong to this convent within Manila, are collected
thirteen pesos a month for rent, which amounts to one hundred and
fifty-six pesos a year.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Contribution from the brothers of our
order.</i>&mdash;The present superior, father Fray Antonio de Arze, by
his great affability established the roll of lay brothers devoted to
our order. Those who at present appear on it regularly number one
hundred and thirty-four and each one has a certain day for supplying
food to the sick; this he compensates with six pesos, which he
contributes as an offering, the amount being thus regulated&mdash;in
all, amounting to eight hundred and four pesos a year.</p>

offerings gathers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203"
name="pb203">203</a>]</span>during the week at least eight pesos, which
amount to two hundred and eighty-eight pesos a year.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Contribution for the feast of our holy
father.</i>&mdash;For the feast-day of our holy father two of our
religious go out a few days before, as representatives of our
community, to ask for contributions among the citizens; and they
collect very nearly two hundred pesos a year.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Contribution of rice.</i>&mdash;In the month of
October in each year a religious is despatched to the province of
Ilocos, in order to push forward the collection and remittance of the
proceeds from the encomienda which is assigned to us in that province,
and at the same time he asks for contributions among the farmers of
that region; he carries, by way of precaution, some medicine, and
benevolently exercises the office of his calling; and if the harvests
are good he collects offerings of about seven hundred baskets of rice.
And so great is the esteem felt in that province for our religious, as
they have acknowledged, that when they go away in the month of March
(which is the time of the monsoon) the people display to them their
regret that they must lack the consolation which they receive during
the stay of our religious, in the assistance given by them to the many
persons stricken by disease.</p>

<p class="par first">[This chapter is devoted to enumeration of the
favors extended by the crown to the hospital order. Maldonado states
that the royal grants to the ecclesiastical estate in the islands (in
stipends and contributions) amount to more than 81,000 pesos a year,
without counting over 11,000 pesos more which are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>allowed to the royal chapel and the hospitals.
The brethren of St. John share in this bounty, to a liberal extent. A
royal decree of June 19, 1680, granted to the order an encomienda of
500 tributes for twenty years, in order to repair the injuries caused
to the hospital buildings by the earthquake of March 15, 1676, and to
aid in carrying on its good work. In accordance therewith, Governor
Cruzelaegui assigned to the order (February 9, 1685) the following
encomiendas: &ldquo;The rest of Purao and Tagurin, and the village of
Pedic in the province of Ilocos, which consists of 115 tributes, vacant
by the death of Captain Don Nicol&agrave;s de Ibar, who was enjoying it
for the second life. Also the encomienda of three-fourths of Pilitan
and its subjects in the province of Cagayan, which consists of 287
tributes, vacant by the death of Juan de Robles Aldaba, which he was
enjoying for the second life. The two amount to 402 tributes;&rdquo;
and they were adjudged to the said order, for the repair of its
buildings, etc., with the charge of paying from the amount thus
collected the amount allowed by the crown for religious purposes and
the stipends of ministers, in the same manner as other encomenderos
must. This grant was afterward extended (by decrees of September 17,
1705, and July 2, 1735); but the assignment of tributes in Cagayan was
later exchanged for another in Ilocos. The net annual proceeds of this
encomienda amount to 500 baskets of rice and 250 blankets; &ldquo;but
if those who make the collections dispense with the fees through
charity, and if the aforesaid goods are conveyed to us at Manila in the
same way, these favors amount to over 100 pesos more.&rdquo; On
November 5, 1704, the treasury officials of Manila assigned to the
brethren <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=

of wine and seventy-five gantas of cocoanut oil for the use of their
church, in the same manner as to the other churches of the city, with
the customary provision that royal confirmation must be obtained within
six years. This was done, but the papers were lost in shipwreck, and
the grant was therefore extended another six years. A royal decree
dated June 29, 1707 (evidently a misprint for 1717), ordered the
treasury officials at Manila to pay the hospital order annually the
value of the said oil and wine; this was received at Manila in 1718,
and from that time the brethren of St. John were paid from the treasury
fifty-nine pesos three reals a year. Governor Zabalburu allotted to the
hospital the services of twelve men from the &ldquo;reserve,&rdquo; a
form of personal service which is thus described:]</p>
<p class="par">This grant, which is called <i lang="es">Reserva</i>,
and among the natives is distinguished by the name of <i>Polo</i>,
takes substantially this form: The natives, or Indians of the four
provinces which are next to Manila, are under this impost (besides the
tributes which they pay to the king), that their laboring men must
render service, at the tasks assigned to them, for the time of one
month in each year. By this measure are furnished [the men for] the
timber-cutting, shipbuilding, and other royal works. To this end, [the
names of] all stand in a very detailed enumeration, each being numbered
for the alternation [in such service] which belongs to each one, and
the apportionment, which is made according to the number of laborers
which each village has. From this levy no one can escape, or excuse
himself; for their <i>mandons</i>, or headmen, even when they find the
laborers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>hindered by other occupations compel them, since
any deficiency affects the service of the king, to pay for other men to
act as substitutes in place of those who obtain excuses. This is all
the harder because the substitutes do not content themselves with the
wages which are assigned to them in the occupation itself, but collect
three pesos besides, at which amount the bonus is settled (unless those
who manage the business have somewhat more for their share) ; and it is
an established custom that this bonus is shared by those whom their
turn exempts. Request is being made to the authorities that for the
churches and other unavoidable needs men be granted for service, to the
number stated, [but] with exemption from these oppressive
circumstances; and that, as a just concession, the warrant for this be
issued, in which is stated the number [of men] and the village from
which they are assigned to this [service, which] is distinguished by
the title &ldquo;reserve.&rdquo; As a fact, those who have to render
this service remain exempt from the turn and apportionment [of service]
of which mention has already been made, without any obligation to
furnish a substitute, or to pay for others to serve. With this, and
with the wages which are paid to them for their labor, we succeed in
obtaining people to assist us.</p>
<p class="par">By other grants, also from this government, there have
been allowed to us fifty &ldquo;reserve&rdquo; vagrants, in order that
our ranch may be cultivated. This is different [from the other],
because the distinctive vagrant is understood as not having a fixed
residence, and not being included in the enumerations of the men liable
to <i>polo</i>; but they burden the lists on account of tribute in
double pay. These men are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href=
"#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>governed by certain officers, who
also impose upon them various works for the royal service; but those
who by means of these &ldquo;reserves&rdquo; reside on ranches remain
exempt, and therefore are occupied in the cultivation of the
grainfields. From this it results that there are laborers for gathering
the harvests, the commonwealth is furnished with provisions, those men
gain the means for their support, and our estates are not lost to us by
lying untilled.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Allowance for the dispensary.</i>&mdash;By this
superior government, and in an ordinance of September 27, 1709, fifty
pesos were applied every year in medicines for the medical treatment of
the sick in our hospitals; and, the expenses of the royal dispensary
having been permanently charged [on the treasury] from the year 1717,
Bachelor Don Miguel de la Torre, a physician of this city, besides the
known saving of expense which he made easy for his Majesty in this
respect, made the offer to increase the allowance for medicines to a
hundred pesos, which was not [formally] assigned, and remains verbal.
This he has fulfilled, but so liberally that without any limitation all
the medicines which have been necessary for the treatment of the sick
have been furnished to us; and our order, always mindful of this
kindness, recognizes the aforesaid Don Miguel de la Torre as one of its
special benefactors.</p>
<p class="par">These are the grants and allowances which this province
at present enjoys, and, most grateful therefor, in all the spiritual
exercises we ask and implore the exaltation of our pious king, a
munificent patron, and we make such return as is possible in our estate
of poverty. For, although in the royal hospital the soldiers receive
treatment, this provision is not extended <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb208" href="#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span>to their children and
wives, or to the mariners of Cabite when sickness prevents their
passage [from that place to Manila]; but all these find succor in our
infirmaries, where they are aided with the comforts which are permitted
by the scanty donations which we obtain. And although we know well how
little merit there is in our labors, as being the proper function of
our Institute, we nevertheless take comfort in this, that in the large
number of those who in these islands are maintained at the royal
expense, we cost the royal treasury least; nor do we count in this the
cost of transportation, or other extraordinary expenses (of which thus
far we have had no benefit [from the crown]); for, as has been stated
in the proper place, this humble province has always maintained itself
by asking for alms.</p>

<p class="par first">[Herein are enumerated the charitable foundations
(<i lang="es">obras pias</i>)<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6710src" href=
"#xd24e6710" name="xd24e6710src">19</a> placed at the disposal of the
Misericordia or of the brethren of St. John. The earliest of these
(although its date is not given) appears to be that of General
Thom&agrave;s Garcia de Cardenas; he gave the Misericordia 12,000
pesos, of which 6,000 should be invested in the Acapulco trade, and the
profits applied to different charities&mdash;among them, 100 pesos
being given to the hospital, which sum is still received by that
institution whenever <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209"
name="pb209">209</a>]</span>the Acapulco galleons make successful
voyages. Another and similar one was founded by Governor Manuel de
Leon, with 50,000 pesos of principal; from the returns of this, 400
pesos were to be applied &ldquo;for the care and comfort of the sick in
our hospitals.&rdquo; Master-of-camp Thom&agrave;s de Endaya in 1703
gave 8,000 pesos to the Misericordia, one-half to be invested in the
Acapulco trade for the benefit of various charities; among these, the
hospital was to receive 100 pesos for purchasing rice for the sick.
Abbot Juan Bautista Sidot (by other writers written Sidoti) in 1705
collected among the citizens of Manila 12,000 pesos, which he invested
in trade&mdash;one-third each in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, China, and the
coast of Yaba (<i>i.e.</i>, Java)&mdash;the returns on all these being
held and added to the principal until they should be equal to 40,000
pesos, which sum was to be invested in the same manner, and its
proceeds devoted to various charities. Of these, the hospital was to
receive 240 pesos annually, thus: 100 pesos for the salary of a
physician, 100 for the cost of the dispensary, and 40 for the salary of
a surgeon. The further sum of 1,100 pesos a year afterward was assigned
to the hospital, since some of Sidoti&rsquo;s plans for aiding other
works proved abortive. A fund of 50,000 pesos, similarly invested in
the Acapulco trade, was given in 1706 by Fray Andr&egrave;s Gonzalez,
O.P., bishop of Nueva Cazeres, from which 400 pesos a year were to be
given to the hospital; he also made provision for distributing every
year certain sums to the curas and missionary fathers in his diocese,
to be spent in aiding the sick poor in their charge&mdash;&ldquo;for
the reason that, having asked permission from the royal Audiencia of
Manila to found a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210"
name="pb210">210</a>]</span>hospital in this city of Nueva Cazeres and
this not having been granted me, I desire that, since there is no
actual hospital, there shall be one in substance.&rdquo; From this
wording Maldonado argues that, in case a hospital should be founded
there, the fund left by Gonzalez for his diocese&mdash;1,305 pesos,
presumably for each year&mdash;might properly be claimed for the aid of
such institution; &ldquo;with the said contribution, and if the natives
of the said province would agree to give [each] a ganta of rice or of
oil, or some other little offering of that sort, a hospital could be
supported which was suitable for aiding the many necessities which
those helpless people suffer.&rdquo; Sargento-mayor Don Antonio
Basarte, a citizen of Manila, established another foundation for the
Misericordia in 1708; he left 50,000 pesos for this, but after the
claims of his legal creditors were satisfied, only 9,849 pesos
remained; this was duly invested, but the proceeds did not reach the
amount of the original 50,000 pesos until 1726, at which time the
returns became available for charitable uses; among these, 250 pesos
were allotted for the meat necessary for the support of the sick in the
hospitals. Captain Manuel Martinez Lobo left a bequest to the
Misericordia;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6733src" href="#xd24e6733"
name="xd24e6733src">20</a> in 1727 this yielded the net sum of 3,300
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>pesos, which was invested in the trade of
Acapulco and Yaba; from the proceeds the officers of the Misericordia
were to apply 50 pesos annually for the poor of the hospital, at the
time when they should make their yearly visitation of that house. In
1727 <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>General Don Joseph de Morales (then steward of
the Misericordia) gave 600 pesos to be invested in trade, from the
profits of which 100 pesos annually were to be given for comforts for
the sick poor in the hospitals. The same officer at dying left a
bequest for charities, in which were included the brethren of St. John;
they were to receive (presumably from the returns made on each galleon)
100 pesos for buying shrouds for the sick who should die in the
hospitals, 100 for clothing for the religious, and 100 for certain
religious functions to be celebrated in their church. Morales&rsquo;s
successor as steward, General Don Domingo Antonio de Otero Vermudes
(who was also chief alguazil<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6757src" href=
"#xd24e6757" name="xd24e6757src">21</a> of the Inquisition), in 1729
founded an <i lang="es">obra pia</i> with 3,000 pesos; from its returns
100 pesos were to be applied for the support of the poor sick in the
hospital. Do&ntilde;a Maria <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href=
"#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>Joachina, the unmarried daughter
of Sargento-mayor Don Juan Antonio Collantes y Peredo, having property
in her own right, left 4,000 pesos for charitable purposes, which
included the payment of 500 pesos yearly for the convalescents from the
hospital; this became available in 1736. Licentiate Manuel Suarez de
Olivera and Do&ntilde;a Maria Gomez del Castillo (his wife?) left some
real estate, on which shops were located, at the place called Los
Arroceros (<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;the rice-mills&rdquo;), outside the city
walls; its proceeds were to be given in equal shares to the hospital
and to the poor who were confined in the prisons. The aforesaid shops
&ldquo;fell into decay, and were rebuilt in 1714, with the stipulation
that from the rent of them should be deducted the third part in order
to repay the amount spent for that construction;&rdquo; this was
accomplished in 1722, after which the full amount was received by the
beneficiaries. It is estimated that this aid amounts to over 150 pesos
a year, and its value is greater or less according to whether the shops
are all occupied; but &ldquo;we receive only what is handed over by the
deputy steward of the prisoners,&rdquo; to whom the collection of these
rents had been entrusted by the Misericordia. Antonio de Arisiga placed
4,000 pesos at interest, for the aid of various charities; from the
income of this he applied 50 pesos annually for the comfort of the sick
in the hospital; but in the course of time this foundation was impaired
by various losses, and the Misericordia divided its income <i lang=
"es">pro rata</i> among its beneficiaries. Juan de Moxica placed at
interest 6,750 pesos, from the income of which should be given twelve
reals for three masses every week, and the rest for the hospital and
treasury <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span>of the Misericordia; this income also became
diminished, like the preceding one, and what was collected was applied
to the aforesaid masses&mdash;although, in Maldonado&rsquo;s opinion,
any money in excess of Moxica&rsquo;s requirement ought to be applied
in equal parts to the hospital and the Misericordia.]</p>
<p class="par">[All the foregoing funds are administered and controlled
by the board of the Misericordia; but the hospital has the benefit of
certain others in the hands of the Third Order of St. Francis. Don
Manuel San Juan de Santacruz established a fund in that order, for
investment in the Acapulco trade; the income was applied to various
charities, among which the hospital was to receive 100 pesos a year. In
1711 a similar fund was given by Sargento-mayor Don Diego Thom&agrave;s
de Gorostiaga, also in the Acapulco trade; from its income, the
hospital was assigned 100 pesos a year. In 1721, another fund was
established by Sargento-mayor Don Juan Lopez, on similar terms, the
hospital receiving from the income 50 pesos a year. A like foundation
from Don Jacome Maria Balestra, made in 1724, brought to the hospital
120 pesos annually. In the same year and in like manner, another fund
was given by the licentiate Don Gabriel de Isturis, which added to the
hospital&rsquo;s income 150 pesos a year. In 1728, an <i lang="es">obra
pia</i> was established in the Third Order by some unknown donor, under
the title of San Raphael; from this 80 pesos were given, half to the
convent of St. John, and half to the hospital. A year later, a similar
fund was established under the title of San Miguel, by Captain Don
Miguel de Caraza; among its beneficiaries, the sick of the hospital
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>received, for their food on certain holy days,
25 pesos a year. All those named in this paragraph were administered by
the said Third Order.]</p>
<p class="par">[Certain funds were established by benevolent women for
charitable purposes, to be at the disposal of our writer, Maldonado.
&ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Margarita Luysa de Avila, who was the widow of
Sargento-mayor Don Nicol&agrave;s de Rivera, from the residue of her
property set aside a principal of 700 pesos for the establishment of a
charitable fund, which should be invested by halves in the trade of
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a;&rdquo; to this Maldonado added 1,000 pesos more,
given to him by various other benefactors, and invested the whole thus,
until its product should bring the fund to a total of 3,362 pesos; it
was then to be divided into three parts, and again invested, its income
being thus apportioned: &ldquo;130 pesos, as the offering for 156
masses, which are celebrated in the church of our convent at Manila,
three on each Monday in the year&mdash;one with an offering of one
peso, and the others with one of six reals each; beginning after
half-past six in the morning, and not before, nor shall they be said at
one time&mdash;as suffrages for the souls in purgatory; and this
stipend can be applied to the fathers belonging to this community who
are priests. Thirty pesos, in order that the reverend father who is
prior or superior of this convent may arrange for chanting a solemn
mass with vigils, and with the assistance of the community, on one of
the days in the octave of the dead, in the month of November, the
suffrages being applied in behalf of the founders. One hundred and
fifty pesos, in order that the reverend father who may be prior or
superior of this convent may distribute <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb216" href="#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>this sum, as is
stated in the foundation of the said fund, for the expenses at the
feast of the <i>gozos</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e6804src" href=
"#xd24e6804" name="xd24e6804src">22</a> of the blessed ever-virgin
Mary, our Lady; these must be celebrated in our church as a seven
days&rsquo; feast, which begins on the day of the patronage of the
blessed St. Joseph, who is honored as the father of Jesus Christ our
Lord&mdash;that is, the third Sunday after Easter. Sixty pesos for the
offering for eighty masses to be said, with the stipend of six reals
each, which the reverend father who is or shall be the prior or
superior of this convent is to arrange for being celebrated during the
said septenary&mdash;fourteen on the first day, and eleven on each of
the other days, and inviting for this function priests by whom it can
be completed, since this community has not a sufficient number of
priests therefor&mdash;in order to fulfil this obligation in the manner
which is prescribed, and the intention of [the founders; the] said
masses must be applied as suffrages for the souls in purgatory, and for
those of the founders. Twenty-five pesos, to be distributed during the
said septenary among the poor, both men and women, who may be in our
infirmaries. Twelve pesos, to be divided as alms among the women
servants of the infirmary for women in our hospital. Twenty-eight
pesos, to be divided, on the first day of the said septenary, among
fourteen Spanish widows, at the rate of two pesos each. Fourteen pesos,
for the cost of wine for masses, so much as is deemed necessary for the
celebration of those which are mentioned in this foundation. Forty
pesos, which must be kept in reserve <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb217" href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>every year for the
repairs on our convent of Manila, according to occasion. This
foundation began to operate in the year 1738, and would be in condition
for distribution if it were not for the loss of a galleon and another
misfortune, which retarded the distribution until the year 1745; and
request has been made that its administration be entrusted to the
venerable arch-confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament that is
established in the church of San Gabriel at Bin[on]doc, a mission
village in charge of the holy Order of St. Dominic, outside the walls
of this city.&rdquo;]</p>
<p class="par">[Another fund in Maldonado&rsquo;s hands is that which
&ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Josepha Ortega, who was the wife of General Don
Antonio Sanchez Cerd&agrave;n, set aside from the main part of her
estate, the sum of 2,500 pesos as a principal, in order that a
charitable fund might be established, at the disposal of the religious
who writes this. According to the instructions communicated to him by
the said foundress, the said principal must be invested in the trade
with Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, its product accruing to it until the fund
should reach the amount of 7,818 pesos 3 reals; in that case it should
be divided into three parts, each of 2,600 pesos 1 real, with which
principal the investment should be continued in the said trade with
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a; and the income of this fund, usually amounting to
1,042 pesos, be distributed in this manner: Ninety-two pesos for the
offering for that number of masses in the chapel of the ward [used as
an] infirmary for women in this hospital of Manila. Twenty-five pesos
for the expenses of the function of [the Virgin&rsquo;s] Solitude,
which is solemnized in our church on the night of Good Friday in each

masses, which are to be solemnized in our church during the septenary
of the most glorious patriarch St. Joseph, at the feast of his
<i>gozos</i>, which begins on the fifteenth day of October. Twenty-five
pesos for the redemption of captives. Thirty-six pesos, to be divided,

septenary, by the superior of this convent and one of the father
chaplains, among deserving poor widows and orphan girls, especially
those who are present in our church at the said festivity. Thirteen
pesos, for the same purpose, among the poor beggars who are present in
our church at the said festivity. Twenty-five pesos, for a hundred
bulls for the living; these will be given as alms by the fathers who
assist in the confessionals in our church during the said septenary,
and who can ascertain the poor who are in need of this favor.
Twenty-five pesos, for the alms of a hundred bulls for the departed,
[to be given] on the day when their memory is celebrated in our church
in the month of November, the suffrage being applied for those who

require. One hundred pesos for the expenses of the arch-confraternity
of the Blessed Sacrament at Binondo, which has been asked to take
charge of the administration of this fund. And 134 pesos one real, in
order that this sum may be separately invested, and with its accrued
products form another foundation, until it shall contain 1,717 pesos
one real as principal; and then, divided into three parts, it may be

of 150 pesos each, to fatherless girls, the daughters of Spaniards, of
virtuous lives&mdash;which dowries are to be allotted on one of the
days of the septenary, in the manner which will be explained. Forty
pesos for the Christmas masses [<i lang="es">missas de Aguinaldo</i>]
which are celebrated in our church of this convent of Manila. Eleven
pesos, for the expenses of the entertainment which must be given to
those who meet in the committee which must be called together for the
choice of the orphans to whom are to be allotted the dowries aforesaid,
during the septenary of St. Joseph, the arrangements for which in
detail are punctually set down here. In order that embarrassments
arising from personal considerations which intervene may be avoided,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=

that the names be presented of those who are needy; and, this having
been ascertained by a special conference which the father who is or
shall be the superior of this convent shall have with the father
priests&mdash;and if there are not two, he shall substitute the chief
councilor&mdash;it shall be declared by the majority of votes who ought
by right to be admitted from the persons who make claims; and, this
settled, the choice shall be made among those who shall be thus
accepted, by drawing lots, and the two dowries shall be awarded to the
girls who shall draw the fortunate lots. The method of the said drawing
shall be, that the names of all those who are accepted shall be
written, each on a slip of paper; and an equal number of other slips,
blank, shall be made, and on two of these shall be written the words,
&lsquo;May I be endowed by the glorious St. Joseph.&rsquo; Then in one
urn, or other suitable receptacle, shall be placed the slips, folded,
on which are written the names of the candidates; and in another urn or
receptacle like the other shall be placed the blank slips&mdash;which,
as already stated, shall be equal in number to those containing the
names, and shall include those on which was written the fortunate lot,
as has been explained&mdash;and both urns shall be shaken. [This shall
be done] in the afternoon of the first day of the septenary; in the
body of the church shall be placed a table with a neat cover, and some
chairs, where the superior [of the Order of St. John] shall sit as
president, accompanied by the priestly fathers who may belong to it; in
case there should be no more than one [of these], the chief councilor
shall assist him. With the aid of the father councilor, a slip shall be
drawn from [the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222"
name="pb222">222</a>]</span>urn containing] the names, and read, and
then another shall be drawn from those that are blank, the writing on
the slips being read aloud, and recorded on a paper which the said
secretary shall keep by him; after this manner the other slips shall be
successively drawn, until from the names those are chosen which the lot
shall indicate; and, as it follows that there will be present in the
church at this function the parties who are concerned, or some one who
can act in their behalf, such person shall be summoned, and the order
for payment handed to her, so that she may obtain her donation of 150
pesos for dowry. And for the orderly management of this business there
shall be made a book of common paper, in which shall be written the
[names and proceedings of the] special committee which shall be called
together to investigate the claims; and they shall endeavor, before the
choice is made, to gain accurate information, in order that the
appointment may be confirmed in accordance with the intention of the
said foundation. At the said committee-meeting the [claims of the]
parties shall be presented, and especially of those admitted to the
drawing, without any opinion being expressed regarding those who shall
not be admitted, or any previous information regarding the decision
being given to the parties concerned. Those admitted to the drawing
shall be notified to come together on the day prescribed, and on the
same day these regulations shall be read, when the superior shall have
reported that he has carried out all their provisions, as appears from
the book of the committee; and the other arrangements that are made for
the fulfilment of this charge shall be put into practice in each
successive <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>year, the full record thereof being afterward

lot the donation that was assigned them has been paid.&rdquo; Maldonado
expects that the income of this foundation as a whole will be available
within six years, if no disaster be encountered; but the provision for
dowries will have to wait twelve years. He states that two things must
be considered, in estimating the value of the funds enumerated in this
chapter: first, that when they were founded the profits on the Acapulco
trade were reckoned at fifty per cent, but at the time when he writes
have diminished at the rate of forty per cent; accordingly, the incomes
of the funds have been distributed <i lang="la">pro rata</i> to the
various beneficiaries. Second, as these incomes depend on the perils of
the sea, they have encountered many losses from shipwrecks; or the
failure of the vessel to complete the voyage, or even to obtain a cargo
at Manila; or the delay in receiving the returns from Acapulco, caused
by an unsuccessful fair there, or by other embarrassments.]</p>

Manila</i></h4>

<p class="par first">The new royal hospital being reestablished, and
all the expenses necessary for its maintenance being <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>provided for in the royal treasury, for its
business management and the assistance of the sick there were allotted
a steward, a physician, a surgeon, nurses, and the other servants who
were deemed necessary; and for its spiritual administration the
discalced religious of the holy order of our holy father St. Francis,
in the province of San Gregorio of these islands&mdash;which
arrangement was approved by a royal decree, dated at Madrid, May 20,
1624. It has continued in this manner up to the present century, when,
on account of the lack of religious for the Indian villages dependent
on the Franciscans, and other just reasons, they were released from the
ministry of the said royal hospital, and the government appointed
secular priests as chaplains, with a suitable income. The cost of
maintaining the hospital in its present condition is reckoned at 6,841
pesos, thus: The chaplain, steward, and physician, at 300 pesos each;
the surgeon, 240;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6880src" href="#xd24e6880"
name="xd24e6880src">24</a> the chief sacristan, three nurses, one
assistant surgeon, the keeper of the wardrobe, the cook, and the
doorkeeper, each 96 pesos; with this the ordinary expense, 1,368 pesos.
[It also requires] 960 cabans of rice, 384 gantas of cocoanut-oil, and
8,400 fowls; also 2,000 pesos, at which amount the provision for
medicines is permanently fixed, and 215 pesos besides, which sum is
allotted for the cost of wine for mass, wax, and other expenses which
are incurred for the titular feast day, which is All Saints&rsquo; day.
Interments are made in the royal chapel of this garrison, which also
has for the year&rsquo;s expenses 3,220 pesos more, without
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>counting the extraordinary expenses which are
necessary during that time in the hospital, for beds, tents, and other
needs, and in the royal chapel for ornaments and the other requirements
of the divine worship. In the said royal hospital, without a special
order from the superior government no other persons are received,
whatever their rank may be, besides the officers and soldiers who are
in actual service; and, although some mariners resort to this
institution&mdash;and these are few, on account of the distance of
their residence, which is in Cabite&mdash;it has not, either, a ward
for women. The steward, the chaplain, and the chief sacristan (who
usually is a priest) have their residence in the said hospital, and are
continually on duty. The physician and the surgeons are present both
afternoon and morning, to visit the sick and give prescriptions for
what seems necessary. The nurses and the other servants lack the
intelligence which is required [in such work], for those who are
occupied in it are poor persons, who have no other situations; and, as
the employment is arduous, they do not remain long in it. Several high
officials, in discussing this matter, have showed their preference that
this responsibility should devolve upon our religious. It is certain
that the object of that same institution calls for different service,
and might also excuse some [further] expense to his Majesty; but as
this depends upon the royal command, it has not proceeded beyond mere
talk.</p>
<p class="par">The hospital of our religious order&mdash;of which
mention will be made further on, as not limited to a special
class&mdash;is a general one, for men and women of all classes; and in
this same holy exercise of their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226"

with the name of San Lazaro, in which are gathered all those who are
stricken by the contagious disease of the same name; it is administered
and cared for by the religious of our holy father St. Francis, and his
Majesty has assigned to it, by virtue of a royal decree of January 22,
1672, a contribution of 1,187 pesos 4 reals every year&mdash;500 pesos
in cash, paid from the royal treasury; the rest is the estimated value
of 1,500 cabans of rice, 1,500 fowls, 200 light Ilocos blankets, and
one arroba of Castilian wine for the holy sacrifice of mass.</p>

it is under the protection of St. Gabriel, and in the charge and
administration of the religious in the venerable Order of Preachers of
the province of the Santissimo Rosario of these islands; it is designed
solely for medical treatment for the Chinese (or Sangleys) who reside
in this country. For its maintenance at the beginning, there was
assigned to it by his Majesty the ferry across the great river which
flows between the said hospital and this city; but this allowance
ceased at the building of the great bridge which afterward was
constructed, and by royal decree of November 26, 1630, the said
allowance was commuted to the sum of 2,000 pesos each year, which is
paid from the communal chest<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6904src" href=

jurisdiction of the province of La Laguna, which is distant five leguas
from Manila, was founded another hospital at the account of his
Majesty; it was for the convalescent soldiers, on account of the
specific properties of the waters of that district, particularly for
venereal diseases [<i>Galicos</i>]. But the institution has been
steadily declining with the course of time, and at present there
remains only one religious from the holy order of our holy father St.
Francis, who is assisted from the royal exchequer with 120 pesos a
year.</p>

fowls for the infirmary which the holy Order of St. Dominic maintains
in the convent at the village of Lalo, the chief town of the province
of Cagayan. By another royal decree, dated January 18, 1706, there are
also issued to the holy order of our holy father St. Francis 100 pesos
for medicines, and the value of 129 pesos in various commodities, and
800 fowls, for the infirmaries which it maintains in this city, [in]
Pagsanhan, the chief town of the province of La Laguna, and [in] Naga,
the chief town of the province of Camarines. It is understood, however,

dwelling for the sick soldiers, who are assisted by a practitioner with
the title of surgeon; for this occupation he is paid four pesos four
reals monthly, and for the treatment of the sick a chest of medicines
is sent from Manila every year. The lack of skill on the part of this
practitioner or surgeon, and, moreover, the fact that less provision is
made for the entire amount of assistance [there given] than the
hospital order requires, enable one to see what the men in garrison
there will suffer. But it is inferred that those are in worse condition
who serve in the garrisons of the fortifications of Nuestra
Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario in Iloylo, San Pedro in Zeb&ugrave;, Santa
Isab&egrave;l of Paragua in Calamianes, San Francisco in Cagayan, and
San Joseph of Tanda in Caraga&mdash;not to mention many other posts
that are dependent on these principal fortresses&mdash;where there is
no attendance of surgeons, and no medicines are sent thither. Our
community, knowing this, shares in their affliction, by not being able
to aid them for lack of the permissions from superiors and the adequate
assistance which were indispensable for the proper care of the
soldiers.</p>

<p class="par">[The book ends with another chapter, headed
&ldquo;Digression xvii,&rdquo; which contains an apology for the
deficiencies of the work, and an account of two miraculous
interventions (by their founder St. John and by an image of the Virgin)
at their convent in July, 1739. On the former subject he says: &ldquo;I

by saying that various other deficiencies that may be encountered are
irreparable; for these natives who serve as amanuenses are so averse to
all orthography that even the greatest exactness in pointing out their
errors, in work of this sort, cannot prevent them from making mistakes.
Some words they separate [from those] to which these belong, and others
they do not divide; they write proper names with a small [initial]
letter, and place capitals in the midst of any word; sometimes they set
down the words without the least understanding of the punctuation. On
this account it is necessary that the reader discreetly supply what
[deficiencies] of this sort he may notice; and if this [manuscript] be
transcribed for any purpose, that it be corrected beforehand&mdash;for
this effort has already been made, but has not been sufficient; nor
would it be, even if the manuscript were copied over and over, for what
is thus made correct in one place is compensated by a new error in
another place.&rdquo; He ends with the usual protestation of loyalty to
the doctrines and precedents of the church, dated at Manila, July 10,

interesting account of this legacy is given by Uriarte in his history
of the Misericordia (<i>q.v.</i>, <i>ante</i>). Lobo, a native of
Viana, in Portugal, died on September 8, 1709, at Aga&ntilde;a in the
Marianas Islands, &ldquo;having executed a power of attorney for
disposing of his estate, in which he left the board of the holy
Misericordia as his executor, declaring his mother, Isabel Gonzales
Lobo&mdash;a widow, and a resident in the said town [<i>i.e.</i>,
Viana]&mdash;the heiress of his property, in case she had survived him.
If not, he named his soul as his heir, with the declaration that
although he had in the said town married Victoria de Silva he had no
children by her, nor had she brought him a dowry at the time and when
they contracted matrimony.&rdquo; The Misericordia made inquiries in
Spain to ascertain whether the mother were still alive, and the wife
brought in a claim for part of Lobo&rsquo;s property; it also appeared
that the deceased had left a sealed will with his uncle, Francisco
Martinez Casados, in Viana. Not until 1723 did the papers arrive from
Spain to settle the difficulties attending this will; it seems to have
been decided earlier that Victoria de Silva was entitled to one-half of
the property gained by Lobo during the period of their marriage
[<i lang="es">bienes gananciales</i>], but the Misericordia refused to
pay out any money until the said documents should arrive from Spain;
also that board administered a large sum of money belonging to Lobo,
which was lent to General Miguel Martinez at interest, and could not be
repaid for several years, especially as his estate was long in probate
and greatly decreased in value. &ldquo;Accordingly, even if the
conveyance of the share belonging to the said Victoria de Silva could
have been made, there was no opportunity for it.&rdquo; Nothing further
is said about Victoria, but the inference is that she had by 1723 died,
or dropped out of sight, or was unable to push her claims further. At
all events, the Misericordia, according to Uriarte, sold the property
and distributed the proceeds according to the terms of Lobo&rsquo;s
will&mdash;having first consulted the learned doctors of the Manila
universities as to their justification in doing so, who fully sustained
the board&rsquo;s course; it followed, then, that their procedure was
lawful and Christian, and that they were not to blame for the delays
which occasioned the final disposition of the estate of Lobo. The
opinion of the Jesuit university is reproduced in full; it is dated
November 2, 1727, and signed by the licentiate Don Francisco Fernandez
Thoribio (apparently an auditor who held the chair of civil law in the
university) and Father Pedro Murillo Velarde, and is fortified by
numerous citations from canons. They decide that, Lobo in his last will
&ldquo;having left his soul as the heir of his property, that means
only the direction that all of it may and should be spent in suffrages,
alms, pious foundations, and other ways which can result for the relief
and welfare of his soul; and in saying that he &lsquo;gives to the
honorable steward and deputies of the Board all his own faculty, amply
and sufficiently,&rsquo; he means that he leaves to the judgment of the
said Board the disposal of his goods, in such manner as shall,
according to the circumstances, appear most to the pleasure of God, and
the welfare and relief of his soul. Accordingly, in virtue of the said
power and faculty the said honorable steward and deputies have
authority to proceed to the execution of the will, in the manner which
we propose.&rdquo; They approve of the bequests made by Lobo for three
chaplaincies; for the aid of the seminary of Santa Isabel and the
support of orphan girls; and for masses for the souls in purgatory.
They recommend that the girls of Santa Isabel set aside the masses and
prayers of a certain day for the repose of Lobo&rsquo;s soul, for which
shall also be said a thousand masses; and that an offering be yearly
made from this estate for the aid of the home for wayward girls, in
which a day shall also be observed with prayers for Lobo&rsquo;s soul.
No mention of Victoria de Silva is made in this opinion.&nbsp;<a class=

<i>Alguazil</i>: one of the many words of law and administration
derived by the Spaniards from the Arabs. The word was originally,
according to Dozy, <i>al-vacil</i>, which was from <i>al-wazir</i>,
&ldquo;vizier.&rdquo; Under the Arabs it was used to denote an officer
of high rank, equivalent to <i>dux</i>. The governors of provinces
under the Ommiade Khalifs sometimes received the title by way of extra
dignity. The Christians used the word down to the fourteenth century as
an equivalent to judge of first instance. Descending lower, in time it
came to designate an officer of the court, the bailiff&mdash;in which
sense only <i>alguacil</i> is now used. (H. E. Watts, in note to his

the Dominicans in Filipinas were strictly forbidden to drink chocolate.
This ordinance was observed for several years, until chocolate became
so cheap and so generally used (even by the poorest Indians and
negroes) that it came to be regarded as a necessity rather than a
delicacy, and the prohibition was removed from the friars. (Salazar,
<i>Hist. Sant. Rosario</i>, p. 379.)</p>
<p class="par footnote cont">The culture of the cacao (<i>Theobroma
cacao</i>), from the seeds of which chocolate is prepared, was
introduced from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a into the Philippines under the rule
of Governor Diego de Salcedo. Murillo Velarde accredits this to the
Jesuit Juan Davila (<i lang="es">Hist. de Philipinas</i>, fol. 395 v.):
&ldquo;He cared for both the temporal and spiritual good of the
Indians, endeavoring that they should possess some means of gain which
would cause them to remain permanently in the villages, in order to
remove the difficulties which ensued from their wandering hither and
yon&mdash;for, going about in this manner, they were not instructed in
the Christian doctrine or in Christian morals&mdash;besides other
damages which they cause. For this purpose he interceded with the
governor, Don Diego de Salcedo, to cause to be brought from Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a some shoots of cacao, in order to plant them in Bisayas.
The governor accordingly obtained them, while the father was at
Carigara, where a plantation was begun with good results; and from that
place it has spread to other villages and islands of
Pintados&mdash;with great benefit to those Indians, and to the general
advantage of all the islands; for this beverage is more necessary here
than in other regions. It is especially so for the ministers [of
religion], who go about in continual voyages and navigations, very
often without having the comfort of having any other provision or
nourishment.&rdquo; Father Davila was born in Sevilla in 1615, entered
the Jesuit order at the age of fifteen; and was ordained in 1639. For a
time he was minister in the college for Irishmen in Sevilla. He came to
the islands in 1643, and labored in the Bisayan missions for many
years; he died in Ylog, Negros, June 20, 1706. For seven years before
his death he suffered from a malignant cancer in the face.
Concepci&oacute;n says (<i lang="es">Hist. de Philipinas</i>, ix, p.
150): &ldquo;Chocolate is a great aid to feeble stomachs; and cacao is
now produced in such abundance that it serves as the common beverage of
every class of people, although it is true that some islands produce it
of better quality and richness than do others.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par footnote cont">The introduction of the cacao which was
made in 1670 (see <span class="sc">VOL. XX</span>, p. 198) is
reconciled with that by Davila thus, by Blanco (<i>Flora</i>, ed. 1845,
p. 420): &ldquo;It is very probable that with the remittance of cacao
plants which came from America at his order, some others were brought
over by private persons; and thus, at the same time when the cacao was
spreading through Carigara (where Father Davila was laboring) and
through other regions, it would also be cultivated by Tagals. In the
year 1674, when Father Ignacio de Mercado was parish priest of Lipa, he
says that he distributed seeds of this tree to many persons.&rdquo; The
allusion here to Tagals refers to San Agustin&rsquo;s statement that
the plant of cacao brought over by Pedro Brabo in 1670 was stolen from
him by an Indian of Lipa, named Juan del Aguila, who hid and cultivated
it; and thence it spread throughout the islands.&nbsp;<a class=

<h2 class="main">LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE INDIA COUNCIL</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">I wrote last year to your most illustrious
Lordship, by way of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a and Portugal, mentioning the
pleasure which I felt at the news that your most illustrious Lordship
held the presidency of the Council of the Indias; for besides the
affection which I profess to your most illustrious Lordship, ever since
I experienced your kindness in Balladolid, I have looked for the like
success in the management of the important affairs which are entrusted
to the Council, and I hope that these unfortunate and remote regions
may have a share in the good results which their government needs.</p>
<p class="par">In regard to the troubles which have afflicted this
commonwealth: The Dutch, keen to avail themselves of opportunities to
extend their commerce, sent hither a warship in the year forty-four,
under pretext of an embassy; it was in charge of Monsieur Duvins, the
second factor in their trade with Japon. He carried letters from the
governor and council of Batavia for the governor and Audiencia here, in
which it was stated that he came to look for a bark named
&ldquo;Cathalina Magdalena&rdquo;&mdash;for which a Swiss heretic had
given pledges to the Company at Batavia with his own person; it had
sailed from here with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href=
"#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>the name &ldquo;Sancta Ana,&rdquo;
and a commission from the governor here; but it was sold to the
Company, who changed its name, and in the charge of the same Swiss it
came back here to trade, with consignments belonging to the Dutch. And
since, in order to send the squadron to China,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6960src" href="#xd24e6960" name="xd24e6960src">1</a> the
departure of the vessels which were in this bay was prohibited, the
said bark was compelled to winter here; and, under pretext of looking
after these [commercial] interests, the Dutch sent their envoy with
credentials. He carried himself, while here, with the air of an
ambassador, and claimed that we should treat him as such, that we
should give him audience in a session of the royal court, and that the
auditors should visit him; but in polite terms he was given to
understand that without express order from his Majesty he could not be
treated as he desired; and it was resolved that answer should be made
to the letters with entire <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href=
"#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>courtesy&mdash;stating that no
such bark as the &ldquo;Cathalina Magdalena&rdquo; had landed at these
islands; but that, if through stress of any storm it should enter our
ports, it should receive succor, and our friendly relations would be
maintained in all things. His principal topic, however, was that free
trade should be permitted to him here, and that the Dutch should bring
us all the merchandise necessary for us. But, as he found no opening
for a proposition of that sort&mdash;on account of the prohibition [of
commerce] in the laws [of the kingdoms] and in the treaties of peace,
and because of the damage which would ensue to the islands from
admitting within them the different religion which neighbors so cunning
and so powerful [as the Dutch] would undertake to impart to
them&mdash;he returned home much disgusted, publishing to the Dutch
that Manila could be captured with five hundred soldiers, and even
urging this enterprise as an easy one on Barnet, the commander of the
English squadron which was then at Batavia.</p>
<p class="par">The Dutch, not discomfited by this repulse, or by the
loss of 50,000 pardaos<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6967src" href=
"#xd24e6967" name="xd24e6967src">2</a> (which are 37,500
pesos)&mdash;which as they write from Batavia, the above-mentioned
ambassador expended&mdash;made an agreement with an English corsair who
was at Batavia, with a ship of fifty-two guns and another of thirty, to
the effect that under his own flag he should escort four Dutch ships,
which they despatched to Acapulco last year with merchandise. And in
order to hinder the galleon from leaving this port they deceived a
Frenchman,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6975src" href="#xd24e6975" name=
"xd24e6975src">3</a> who was very well known <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>here, hinting to him that the squadron of
Barenet [<i>sic</i>] and the corsair were going to attack Manila; and
they hastened his embarkation, at the cost of 4,000 pesos, in order
that he might notify us here. Then they gave orders to the corsair,
with two other ships of their own, to let themselves be seen at the
entrance of Mariveles, in order to throw Manila into alarm and hinder
the sailing of the galleon. By [causing] this fright they succeeded in
their purpose to prevent the sailing of the ship, which was lightened
of its cargo as soon as the information which the Frenchman gave
reached us; and the 4,000 pesos were paid [to him] for the cost of this
warning. The said four ships sailed to leeward, and sighted the coast
of Ylocos, whence we had news of this. But they could not attain their
principal object; for when the six ships had come together in China,
and were laden with [goods worth] 900,000 pardaos (each containing six
silver reals), they expected the vessel which, after having given that
warning here, was to cross over to China<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6991src" href="#xd24e6991" name="xd24e6991src">4</a> and carry to
the Dutch <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>a pilot for the navigation to Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a; but it could not reach China, and was obliged to go to
Batavia. The four Dutch ships and the two [English] corsairs, resolved
to carry out their project, sailed from Canton on the fourteenth of
September, bound for the coast of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a and Per&uacute;
to carry on illicit trade,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7002src" href=
"#xd24e7002" name="xd24e7002src">5</a> and the English to make
reprisals. But God, who chose to punish so mischievous a design,
permitted that a hurricane should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235"
href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>attack them, when they were
four days out from Canton; and as a result the two corsairs were driven
back to China&mdash;the larger vessel dismasted and battered, and the
smaller one badly damaged. The four Dutch ships, badly leaking, spent
twelve days in searching for an anchorage on the coast of Ylocos, in
order to make repairs; but not finding one, they went back to Batavia,
with their goods damaged. According to what is written to us in a
despatch that is just received from Batavia&mdash;from a person who was
sent there from here to make observations on the condition of the
English piratical squadron&mdash;the Dutch lost on their merchandise
half of its value; and the corsair sold for 17,000 pardaos his ship of
fifty-two guns, with all its military supplies, since it was no longer
fit for navigation, while he went with the other and smaller
ship&mdash;it is said without [stopping for] food&mdash;to another port
to repair it. [It is also reported] that the squadron of Barenet had
departed for Bombain, toward the Persian Gulf, to cruise against the
French, from whom he seized at the Straits [of Malacca] nearly a
million pesos. The person who was sent from here to Batavia (who is a
Malabar) with a balandra was detained there under the pretext that the
governor had gone away, and orders were given that he should not be
permitted to depart until the governor&rsquo;s return. But he informed
us of everything, by a vessel which he despatched with six men and a
French pilot; and he reported that three Dutch fragatas were being
equipped and laden with merchandise in order to carry on illicit trade
at the entrance of [the Gulf of] Californias, carrying [respectively]
forty, thirty, and twenty-five cannon. In his opinion, this was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>the cause of his detention, in order that, by
news [from him] not reaching Manila, the galleon should not sail for
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and their intention not be known here.</p>
<p class="par">On account of all these advices, and those which we had
previously received by way of China making the same statement about the
English, it was resolved here that, since the chief [cause for] fear,
which was the said squadron&mdash;which occasioned the letter with
order from the Marqu&eacute;s de la Ense&ntilde;ada,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e7014src" href="#xd24e7014" name="xd24e7014src">6</a> to give
warning that a ship should not sail from here with cargo&mdash;had
ceased, and since the commonwealth was in the most deplorable
extremity, with a shipment of goods which had been driven back to port,
and laden and unladen the second time, and in evident risk of being
lost, a final effort was made by dividing the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237</a>]</span>cargo between two ships equipped for war. One of
these carried seventy cannon and the other fifty-two (seventy and forty
[respectively] being mounted), and a corresponding number of men,
resolved to defend their property and with sufficient force to make
resistance to the entire squadron of Barenet, whose ships carried
fifty-two, forty-five, forty, and thirty cannon. For the cost of this
enterprise the body of merchants offered to aid with 50,000 pesos in
Acapulco; and this effort seemed necessary, for, as the viceroy of
Mexico had orders not to allow any money to come here, he understood
them so strictly that last year he sent a bark<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7019src" href="#xd24e7019" name="xd24e7019src">7</a> without one
real. Nevertheless, he was not ignorant that the situado had not been
sent here for three years: that with this, and the failure of the
[Acapulco] trade, the treasury of the islands ran short 60,000 pesos
each year in customs and anchorage duties; that the citizens would
necessarily be reduced to poverty, and that these domains were utterly
helpless; and that by despatching the aid in November it would arrive
here in entire safety from the English&mdash;who only through general
lack of military foresight were able to secure the prize which they
made; for these islands have various ports where our ships can land
(thus mocking the enemy), as occurred in the late war; but when they
come by the ordinary route and the artillery is in the hold, no other
result [than their capture] can be expected.</p>
<p class="par">The damage, most illustrious Sir, is already done,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>but it calls to heaven for a remedy for the
future. That which I propose is, that, since [the merchandise for] this
commerce was formerly supplied, either by sending our barks to the
Malabar coast, or by Armenians, Moros, or Malabars coming thence with
their ships and goods&mdash;only tolerating that they might bring some
French pilot&mdash;orders be given to observe this plan so strictly
that warning be given to the Audiencia, the archbishop, and the city
[of Manila] that they shall give information if the governor shall
contravene those orders, and some exemplary punishment be meted out.
For the despotic power which the governors, under pretext of their
services, have assumed is great; and the freedom which they have given
to the English and the French<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7029src" href=
"#xd24e7029" name="xd24e7029src">8</a> has arrived at being general
license. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>From this prohibition it follows that they
cannot gain so much knowledge about the country and its forts, and that
they cannot so greatly injure this commerce, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>[as
hitherto]; for the Asiatics are never so shrewd as the Europeans, and
their only concern is for their business, without meddling in
observations of our forts or our forlorn condition. To this remedy I
add that which I have proposed to the Council, and which on this
occasion I repeat.</p>
<p class="par">Observing the aforesaid freedom, the Dutch have ventured
to come [against us] with the ease which the Swiss heretic had
represented to them; and if this Swiss had not been allowed to come
here with his bark, he would not have involved us in such difficulties
with the Dutch, for they, in pique, undertook to introduce their
commerce into Nueva Espa&ntilde;a&mdash;tempting the viceroy with
300,000 pesos which they carried thither last year, planning to give
him this money so that he should tolerate [their trading]. And since
they are now returning I fear that they are planning to occupy some
port in California,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7050src" href=
"#xd24e7050" name="xd24e7050src">9</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb241" href="#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span>in order that it may
serve them as a magazine&mdash;like the island of Curazas [<i>i.e.</i>,
Curacoa] in the North Sea&mdash;and to make arrangements for carrying
on their commerce from Batavia with the same ease as from here. And in
order to prevent these or others from undertaking such a scheme (which
would be the destruction of America), I have collected testimony
regarding all which can aid the Council to realize how, without any
expense to the royal treasury, and with the men of whom we have here
more than enough belonging to the navy-yard and ships, [Manila] can be
fortified for that part of America, for the security of both these and
those domains; but I hope for the success of the former proposition, in
order not to pile up schemes. I assure your most illustrious Lordship
that this can be pushed forward in a way which will be very useful to
the nation; because, in order to keep the Dutch under control, it is
enough that they know that we keep in readiness the three galleons each
of seventy cannon, which the commerce ought to have, and four fragatas
besides, with which we can disturb the commerce of the Straits for the
inland regions. This is especially easy to do with the English,
because, even though they send squadrons from Europa, many of their men
die, and they use up their men as fast as they gain ground; and in this
country they can never do us harm if we do not give way [to
negligence], as hitherto [we have done].</p>
<p class="par">I hope that your most illustrious Lordship will
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>pardon the annoyance of this, as springing from
my zeal<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7067src" href="#xd24e7067" name=
"xd24e7067src">10</a> for the service of the king and the welfare of
the nation; and I confide in the inborn devotion [thereto] of your most
illustrious Lordship, whose life I entreat God our Lord to preserve for
the many years which I desire and need. Manila, July 16, 1746. Most
illustrious Sir, I kiss the hands of your most illustrious Lordship.

been declared by England against Spain in October, 1739, in consequence
of injuries inflicted on British commerce in the West Indies; but
letters of marque and reprisal had been issued by the English
government in July preceding, under which Captain Edward Vernon
captured the city of Portobello (November 22, 1739), and the castle at
Cartagena. Captain George Anson also was placed in command of a large
fleet, to harass the Spaniards along the coast of Peru, then to proceed
northward, attack Panama, and capture the Spanish treasure-fleet, in
which proceedings Vernon was to co&ouml;perate with him. Anson&rsquo;s
fleet was broken up by storms and sickness, and the two commanders
failed to make connections; so Anson, after various depredations on the
western coast of South America, sailed to China, where he repaired his
ship. Then he set out to meet the Spanish galleon from Acapulco, the
&ldquo;Covadonga;&rdquo; and on June 30, 1743, Anson captured this
vessel after a hot fight, with over 1,500,000 pesos of silver, mostly
in coin. To avenge this loss, a squadron of four ships (the one here
mentioned in our text) was despatched by the Manila government in
pursuit of Anson; they went to China, but could not find the
Englishman, who had sailed for his own country.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

cannon, guns and ammunition, his envoy being a Frenchman who was well
accredited in the foreign factories, named Antonio Pi&ntilde;on, who is
probably the man mentioned by Calderon. Pi&ntilde;on returned to Manila
with those supplies, to the value of 38,995 pesos. (Concepci&oacute;n,

clear that the name China (which the French and Italians pronounce
Cina) is not the original name of that kingdom, but is one imposed upon
it by the foreigners who went thither to trade and barter; it was
adopted by the Portuguese, and afterward by our people of the
Philippines. Father Julio Aleni, a Jesuit, in a book written in the
Chinese language says, in discussing this point: &ldquo;China,
according to foreigners, signifies &lsquo;the country or kingdom of
silk;&rsquo; and, since there is so great abundance of that commodity
therein, those who sailed thither to buy it would say, &lsquo;Let us go
to the country of silk,&rsquo; or &lsquo;to China,&rsquo; which means
the same. The like statement was made to me by Don Fray Gregorio Lopez,
bishop of Basilea, in whose charge is now the church of China, a
religious of ours, and a native of that empire. To this opinion also
incline Trigautius and Kircher.&rdquo; The most common and ordinary
name which those people give to their empire, not only in books but in
conversation, is Chung Kue, that is, &ldquo;the kingdom in the
middle.&rdquo; In former times they gave this name to the province of
H&ograve; Nan, which lies almost in the middle and heart of that
empire; from that region it was afterward applied to that entire
country. Others say that the Chinese regarded their kingdom as being in
the middle of the world, through their ignorance of the many kingdoms
that the world contains. For that reason they also call it Tien Hia,
that is, &ldquo;the world,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;the largest or principal
part of the world.&rdquo; Another name they very commonly give to it,
calling it Hoa Kue, or Chung Hoa, which means &ldquo;flowery
kingdom,&rdquo; or &ldquo;garden, forest, and pleasant place of the
middle of the world.&rdquo; In the time of the emperor Xun this name
was much used, and it is still used in literature. It is a very
suitable name for that empire, for in truth it is throughout a
beautiful garden and a peaceful and pleasant forest. (Domingo F.

Apparently a member of the royal Council; he sent orders that during
the war with Great Britain no galleon should sail from Manila for
Acapulco, stating that the king thus decreed in order to prevent those
rich cargoes from falling into the hands of the English. The merchants
petitioned Governor Arrechedera to suspend this decree, at least by
permitting them to send to Acapulco the goods which had been registered
for that port three years before&mdash;which were already damaged by
this delay, and would be ruined by a longer one; he did so (with the
advice of his counselors), and the galleon &ldquo;Rosario&rdquo; and
the patache &ldquo;Pilar&rdquo; were sent with cargoes in June, 1746.
To accomplish this, in the exhausted condition of the colonial
treasury, the merchants were obliged to contribute 50,000 pesos for the
outfitting of the ships and other expenses; and the royal officials,
with the consent of the ecclesiastical cabildo, borrowed from the funds
in the treasury belonging to the cathedral 29,805 pesos. The ships were
manned with crews of 500 and 350 men respectively. They made the voyage
safely, and returned to Manila with the situado for that year and
30,000 pesos on the arrearages in those of previous years. The
&ldquo;Rosario&rdquo; was again despatched with a cargo, and with
request for the situados which had been held back in Mexico; as these
amounted to six, the islands were in great need, and the royal treasury
almost empty; but the vessel was ill-constructed, and was driven back
to port by storms.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

devotes book iv of his <i lang="fr">&Eacute;tablissemens et commerce
des Europ&eacute;es</i> (t. i, pp. 400&ndash;548) to the
&ldquo;voyages, settlements, wars, and commerce of the French in the
East Indies.&rdquo; The first voyage to India undertaken by a French
commercial company (1601) was commanded by Pyrard de Laval, whose
account of his adventures in the Maldive Islands has already been cited
in these volumes; but this enterprise was unsuccessful. After various
abortive attempts by Frenchmen to engage in the Oriental trade, an East
India Company was formed in France (1664) by the great Colbert, with an
exclusive charter and many special privileges. The company made a
settlement in Madagascar, which was abandoned in 1670, and the French
ships then went to India, where they established a post at Surat, and
afterward one at Pondicherry. At first the trade prospered, especially
at the latter post; but after a time the affairs of the company were
mismanaged, its funds diminished so that ruinous expedients, only
temporarily successful, were resorted to; its markets at home were
spoiled by the sale of India goods, taken by French privateers from
English and Dutch prizes, at very low prices; for lack of money, the
company could not keep up its purchases in India; heavy duties were
laid on all India goods; the conduct of the home government toward the
company was, although vacillating, generally oppressive, and its
administration corrupt; and the company long struggled on the brink of
ruin. At the end of the fifty years&rsquo; term of their charter, they
secured (1714) an extension for ten years more; and in the period of
&ldquo;frenzied finance&rdquo; engineered by John Law (1716&ndash;21)
various other trading companies were merged in this one, which later
was substantially aided by the French government. For a time the
company acquired great power and extensive territories in India; but
war broke out between France and England, and in 1761 Pondicherry was
captured and destroyed by the English. Afterward, from 1764 to 1769,
the company conducted a prosperous Oriental trade; but its affairs had
long been mismanaged, and the government had meddled with these unduly,
while there had been much corruption among both its directors and its
officials. It was found to be heavily indebted, and its finances fell
into almost hopeless confusion; and finally a royal decree dated August
15, 1769, suspended the exclusive privileges granted to the Company of
the Indies, and gave all Frenchmen liberty to navigate and trade beyond
the Cape of Good Hope. The company thereupon undertook to liquidate
their affairs, and made over to the government (April 7, 1770) their
property, the latter assuming the debts and obligations of the
company.</p>
<p class="par footnote cont">In the period 1725 to 1770, the East India
Company of France sent out 761 trading ships, an average of 17 each
year; the number in 1725 was 33, but it dwindled toward the close of
that period until, in 1769, it was but 3; the ships, during the 45
years, were manned by 87,223 men, an average of 115 to each ship. The
amount of merchandise carried to the Indias varied from 7,800,000
livres&rsquo; worth (in 1769) to 612,000 (in 1764), and for the entire
period was 133,000,000. The vessels that returned to France numbered
585; they carried thither goods which had cost 344,000,000 livres in
the East, and which were sold in France for 636,000,000: the years in
which these sales produced most profit were: 1741, a gain of 12,327,000
livres; 1752, 13,719,000 livres; and 1755, 12,785,000 livres. During
the first decade, the company paid on its sales, as duties to the
crown, the sum of 25,000 livres annually; then until 1765, with a few
exceptions, 3,000 livres a year; and during 1765&ndash;71, sums varying
from 538,000 to 126,000 livres a year. The annual dividends varied
usually from eight and a quarter to three millions of livres; steadily
decreasing (in groups of years) to the latter figure; in 1746 the
dividend was 15,000,000, but in that year the company borrowed the
large sum of 25,000,000. In 1765 the dividend was but 766,000 livres.
Its capital in 1725 was 100,000,000 livres due from the crown, and
39,835 in its ships and other assets. In June, 1747, the government
increased its obligations to the company to 180,000,000 livres, in
compensation for depriving it of the monopoly of the sale of tobacco,
and engaged to pay it the interest on that sum forever at the rate of
five per cent. (See a tabulated statement of the affairs of the French
company, at the end of the atlas volume of Raynal&rsquo;s work.)</p>
<p class="par footnote cont">After the exclusive privileges of the
company were suspended, the India commerce was carried on by private
persons, and steadily flourished. Raynal presents another table,
showing the net product of this private commerce, as indicated by the
sales at the French port of l&rsquo;Orient, during 1771&ndash;78
inclusive, of merchandise brought from the Indies, China, and the
islands of France and Bourbon; it shows a regular and large increase,
save in 1778. The amounts of these sales vary from 10,336,000 livres in
1771 to 27,509,000 in 1777; in the following year the amount was but
14,026,000. The total sales for the eight years amounted to 149,273,000
livres, an annual average of 18,659,000.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<h2 class="main">LETTER OF A JESUIT TO HIS BROTHER</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">As the ships which in the years 47 and 48 sailed
from here to Acapulco were driven back to these islands, the letters
which in those years I wrote to my brother could not be despatched.
This obliges me to avail myself of a safer opportunity, that afforded
by the voyage of the father procurators, Pedro Murillo<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7088src" href="#xd24e7088" name="xd24e7088src">1</a>
and Bernardo Pazuengos, who for many and important reasons are going to
Europe by way of the coast (that is, the Orient) in a French ship which
is going from here to France. In the letters which I wrote in past
years, I informed my brother of the enterprise of the missions in
Jol&oacute; and Mindanao, in which we were involved by the governor of
these islands, Fray Juan de Arrechedera, by the hasty remittance of the
letters despatched from Don Felipe (whom may God keep) to the sultans
of Jol&oacute; and Mindanao, and with his own energetic exhortations
and promises to our provincial&mdash;so that he gave no opportunity to
take any counsel, or to furnish means for avoiding the most serious
difficulties. [The worst of these] was, as we soon perceived, that at
the very time when he despatched with embassies the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>letters of our king to the said sultans, the
said Governor Arrechedera sent an urgent invitation to the sultan of
Jol&oacute; to come to Manila, where he would be hospitably received
and entertained. We all knew that the object of the governor was, that
the sultan might bring here abundance of pearls and gold; and we also
knew that with the departure of the sultan from his kingdom the mission
would come to an end, as has actually happened.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7096src" href="#xd24e7096" name="xd24e7096src">2</a> At the time
we were only mistaken in one thing, and that was, to feel sure that the
fathers would not leave Jol&oacute; or Mindanao; for we reckoned that
if the sultan should leave Jol&oacute; the natives would kill the
fathers of that mission, and the sultan would easily justify himself
because the act had been committed in his absence, and he could even
pretend great sorrow for the deaths of the fathers; and in Mindanao,
when it was known that in Jol&oacute; they had killed the fathers, they
would do the same there to those engaged in the Mindanao mission.</p>
<p class="par">In reality the fathers had arrived at Zamboanga. When
the Moros found themselves obliged to receive the fathers in their
kingdoms, according to the promise which they had given in their
replies to our king and to the governor of Manila, the two sultans
agreed between themselves that after they had admitted the fathers [to
their countries] they would treacherously kill them, and so that their
murder could not be attributed to the influence of the sultans. The
means which the sultan of Jol&oacute; took was, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name="pb245">245</a>]</span>that
after he left his kingdom they should kill the fathers&mdash;although
God our Lord disposed affairs otherwise from the schemes which the
sultan, with unheard-of craft and perfidy, had plotted.</p>
<p class="par">In order that my brother may be fully informed, and may
correctly relate everything to all those whom my brother may think
expedient to tell of it, I send that enclosure which Father Ygnacio
Malaga wrote to me; this account is worthy of entire credence, since he
was almost an eyewitness of everything which he relates, being one of
the missionaries appointed for Mindanao.</p>
<p class="par">If what Governor Arrechedera is doing here in Manila
with the sultan of Jol&oacute; could be known in Madrid and Roma, and
in every other country, people would have no difficulty in believing
the enormous perfidy, treachery, and deceit of the said sultan and
other Moros. It is nearly a year since the said sultan of Jol&oacute;
arrived at Manila, accompanied by three concubines and several
slave-girls. At his arrival the artillery was discharged; and he was
lodged very magnificently, in a house provided beforehand for this
purpose, outside the walls of Manila, with a continual guard of
soldiers, whose captain was always under the orders of the sultan. The
entry of the sultan into Manila was arranged with so much pomp and
ostentation that everyone said no more could have been done for the
entry of the prince of Espa&ntilde;a if he should come to Manila; but
all that is told is less [than the reality]. The governor seeing a
scarf woven with pearls and ornaments in gold, immediately his eyes and
his heart went out toward the scarf and the many other pearls and
jewels which he knew the sultan carried. At this the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>governor entirely closed his eyes to all the
information that was given to him&mdash;not only that furnished by the
fathers of the said missions who had come back to Manila, but the
letters which the governor of Samboanga had written to him&mdash;openly
saying that he placed more confidence in the king of Jol&oacute; than
in the fathers who sent the information. What causes most general
sorrow here (and especially to the archbishop)<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7109src" href="#xd24e7109" name="xd24e7109src">3</a> is, that on
account of the governor not being willing to listen to anything against
the sultan, that is coming true which the fathers said to his
Lordship&mdash;that the said sultan from Manila would cause the ruin of
these islands, causing the Jol&oacute;ans by piratical raids to carry
away many Christian Indians as captives, and to destroy churches and
villages. This is what they are actually doing, as is written by the
fathers in Visayas, whose letters I have seen within a few days, and
the governor will not permit that a word be uttered in order that it
may not be said (although it is well known) that the Moros are
destroying the island with the gunpowder and balls which have been sent
them from Manila, and the sultan is paying for them with the pearls and
gold which he has given to the said governor. What continually renews
the grief of all is, that not only <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247"
href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>is no remedy applied to so
dire evils, but that the governor continues to entertain the sultan in
Manila as if he were our friend or defender, while he is the greatest
traitor and enemy that this Christian church has had; and we greatly
fear that by this time the said sultan is making himself master of the
post at Samboangan.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7117src" href=
"#xd24e7117" name="xd24e7117src">4</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">It is sufficient to have pointed this out in order that
my brother may gain knowledge of the condition in which affairs are.
What concerns the mission in Mindanao is made sufficiently clear in the
letter from Father Ygnacio Malaga, and everything that he says is the
simple truth; but, in order that this truth may not be smothered with
the reports which this governor of Manila is sending to the court at
Madrid, I have sent my brother that letter of Father Malaga, entreating
him to please show it to the father procurator-general Pedro Ygnacio
Altamirano, and to any other person whom my brother may think best, for
the sake of the credit of this province and of the entire
Society&mdash;for they do not lack many rivals, who are not willing
that the ill-success of the missions of Jol&oacute; and Mindanao should
be attributed to the perfidy and malice of the Moros; but they try to
charge it to the very fathers of the Society.</p>
<p class="par">My brother will also please tell the father procurator
Altamirano how the father provincial Pedro de Estrada had written to
inform his Reverence that all the letters of contract on our side in
favor of his illustrious Lordship Fray Arrechedera could not be worded
otherwise, since we found ourselves obliged to this by the urgent
request of the governor himself, and he had to see all of them. But in
reality the course of the said governor cannot in conscience
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>be approved [<i lang="es">abonar</i>] except
with the reflection that Father Altamirano knows very well that our
letters on this matter were being misconstrued, and that his Reverence
would not be influenced to bind himself in virtue of them to favor the
said Se&ntilde;or Arrechedera. In order to make this more certain, the
said father provincial Estrada wrote a letter in order that the said
Father Altamirano should not pay any attention to this undertaking of
ours; and I, as his secretary at the time of the said father
provincial, wrote the third letter, as I did all the rest.</p>
<p class="par">Now it is evident to me that the archbishop of Manila is
informing his Majesty very thoroughly of the proceedings of the said
governor; and certainly it would go ill with us with the king and his
Council, if our reports should be presented in favor of the said
governor, while those which the archbishop is now sending are entirely
contrary to this. Here we are, as if in Limbo, for we have not had
mails from Europe for more than three years, except the news which came
from China and Batavia.</p>
<p class="par">The father provincial Pedro de Estrada died at the end
of the year 48; his office was temporarily filled by Father Jos&eacute;
Samaniego, and in seven months he also died. God our Lord has freed
these islands from the scourge of the English, for the squadron of
forty-three ships which was destined for this coast undertook first to
seize Pondicheri and Madr&aacute;s (which they thought would be an
affair of a few days), and then go on to Philipinas; but they did not
capture either Pondicheri or Madr&aacute;s, and much or even the
greater part of the squadron was destroyed in a fierce storm. If they
had come here, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>it is certain that now this country would be in
the power of the English; for all the precautions that were taken here
for our defense were festivities with the sultan of Jol&oacute; and his
concubines, to the profound sorrow of the community; etc. Cavite,

this, and refused to obey. In May, 1740, a Recollect priest, Fray
Hypolito de San Agustin, was captured by Moro pirates; but certain
Joloans&mdash;especially their pandita, one Yaloc&mdash;rescued him and
took him to Jol&oacute;, where he was kindly received and cared for.
The sultan demanded a ransom of 12,000 pesos for him; after many
difficulties and negotiations, and some aid from the Jesuits, the
captive priest secured his liberty by binding the Recollect province to
pay the amount demanded for ransom. Soon afterward, the sultan was
persuaded by Commandant Zacharias and the Jesuit Isasi at Zamboanga to
commute his claim to 1,000 pesos, which was gladly paid by the
Recollects. The peace made with Alimudin stopped the invasions by the
Joloans, but the Tirones from the Bornean coast continued their
destructive raids. Remonstrances being made at Madrid by the
representatives of Philippine interests, the king wrote the letters to
the rulers of Jol&oacute; and Tamontaca (the latter being Ameril
Mahomenin Campsa), which have been previously mentioned in this series;
they were received at Manila in July, 1746, and were sent to their
destination by the hands of the Jesuits Isasi and Arcada. These envoys
conducted various negotiations with the sultan, who demanded (and
received) from the Manila government aid of money, guns, and
iron&mdash;for Jol&oacute;, to repay him for the expenses which he had
incurred in aiding the Spaniards against the Tirones; for Tamontaca (or
Mindanao), to aid in the war with Gula<span class="corr" id="xd24e7125"
title="Source: .">,</span> the son of the rebel Malinog. Arrangements
were made for the opening of Jesuit missions in Jol&oacute; and
Tamontaca; but they soon came to naught. In September, 1748, a
rebellion in Jol&oacute; unseated Alimudin, and sent him a fugitive to
Zamboanga; and, Ameril and Gula having become reconciled, threatened
treachery sent the Jesuit Moreno back from Tamontaca to the same
refuge. Alimudin went to Manila, here he was received with much
&eacute;clat by Governor Arrechedera; he was there apparently converted
to the Christian faith by the governor&rsquo;s
persuasions.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

advantages which the said islands ought to yield to his Majesty (whom
may God preserve).</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">[This will seem] a strange statement when it is
considered that the Philipinas Islands since the year 1565 have caused
to Espa&ntilde;a every year a very great expense, without affording the
least temporal advantage; and when I now try to demonstrate the
advantage and benefit of them to the crown of Espa&ntilde;a some will
say that it is already time to stop; and others will ask, &ldquo;Who is
this newcomer<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7203src" href="#xd24e7203"
name="xd24e7203src">2</a> who so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254"
href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>boldly tries to persuade us
that the Spaniards have neglected their duty for one hundred and
ninety-two years?&rdquo; But so it is, and now is the time to warn them
of this neglect; and, although ignorance attempts to prevent this, it
shall not make me desist from the undertaking. I desire that his
Majesty (whom may God preserve) may have positive knowledge of the
treasure which he possesses in the Philipinas Islands; and I am
undertaking to place before his Majesty plain and clear evidence that
they can and ought to furnish very great profit, and maintain
themselves from their own products.</p>
<p class="par">I make no pretensions as an author, nor do I claim to
have the ability for that; therefore let us lay aside panegyrics, which
are so unprofitable; for, even if this little work deserves them, that
does not comport with my purpose, which is simply the service of his
Majesty and the advancement of his realms.</p>
<p class="par">As regards all that I shall be able to state of the
products of commodities which the said islands yield, in order that
every one may know that I do not advocate something that is not so, I
recommend (although various persons have written on the subject) to the
curious the two books of the reverend master Father Pedro Murillo
Velarde, of the Society of Jesus, entitled <i lang="es">Historia de las
Islas Philipinas</i> and <i lang="es">Historia geografica</i> of the
same Philipinas Islands.</p>
<p class="par">These are worthy of attention, and in regard to what is
theoretical can furnish much light; as for what concerns the practical,
and the experience <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255"
name="pb255">255</a>]</span>which I have acquired at the cost of much
money, labor, and application, I must make evident all the
following.</p>
<p class="par">First: We must consider what commodities or products
these islands contain or produce, as well as the fact that we do not
have to build castles in the air or proceed on fanciful assumptions;
all that I assert shall be from my own knowledge.</p>
<p class="par">Second: Whether the products or commodities can be used,
and to explain and demonstrate how we can avail ourselves of them; and
all that I shall say on this subject will proceed from the long
experience which I have had.</p>
<p class="par">Third: The advantages and benefits which will redound to
his Majesty, to the Spaniards settled in those regions, and to the
Indians themselves.</p>
<p class="par">The first point: As the products of the Philipinas
Islands are enumerated by the reverend Father Murillo (whom may God
keep in Paradise), whom I have cited, and those of each island
separately, in order not to extend this little work needlessly I will
state the most important ones, which are the following: Rice, sugar,
cotton (of choice quality and very fine), indigo, sulphur, siguey,
balate, wax, pepper, coffee, tortoise-shell, mother-of-pearl; gold,
mines of iron, and mines of copper (like that of Japon); tobacco,
brazil-wood [<i lang="es">sibucao</i>], and pearl-fisheries; oil,
cacao, birds&rsquo;-nests, and ebony wood; lead (I believe that, as for
the soil in some parts of Bisayas,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7235src"
href="#xd24e7235" name="xd24e7235src">3</a> it melts into lead, just as
in the island of Mauricius, which belongs to the French, it melts into
iron); <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>cocoanuts, which produce abundance of
oil;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7243src" href="#xd24e7243" name=
"xd24e7243src">4</a> horses; deer and buffaloes, from which the people
make what they call <i>tapa</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, dried beef], and also use
the sinews; and bichuca, or rattans.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7259src" href="#xd24e7259" name="xd24e7259src">5</a></p>
<p class="par">The above-mentioned products are very abundant, and
exceedingly easy to collect. I do not, however, wish to include the
following, for the reasons which I have mentioned: Lead, [of which] I
have not personally actual experience, although I regard it as being as
sure as all the others; coffee, which, as it is not cultivated, is not
abundant, and its consumption is small for exportation, less than it
would be for Espa&ntilde;a or Europa; iron, [the working of] which,
although it is very abundant, they have not yet succeeded in
perfecting; the pearl-fisheries, which are not operated; copper, the
mines of which are not worked; and cocoanuts, which are little used
outside [the islands] except for oil and nails.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7273src" href="#xd24e7273" name="xd24e7273src">6</a></p>
<p class="par">The second: The commodities that I have mentioned are
exported to the places that are enumerated as follows, and sell at
prices that are very profitable<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257"
href="#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>&mdash;although commerce has,
as in all regions, its ups and downs [<i lang="es">sus altos y
bajos</i>]. To various ports of China: rice, sugar, cotton, indigo,
bichuca or rattan, balate, pepper, tortoise-shell, mother-of-pearl,
brazil-wood, ebony, <i>tapa</i>, the sinews of cattle,
birds&rsquo;-nests, and lead when they have it. To the Malabar coast
and Persia: sugar in large quantities, which is sold for money. To the
Coromandel coast and Bengala: sugar, indigo, brazil-wood, sulphur,
pepper, siguey, birds&rsquo;-nests, cotton, and often rice.</p>
<p class="par">The third: The advantages and benefit which will accrue
to his Majesty from the commerce and exportation of the commodities and
products of those same islands are various, to wit: The more that the
commodities which they need from outside can be supplied from the
native products of the islands themselves, the more silver remains in
the [Spanish] dominions. The more commodities or fruits are exported,
so much more land will be cultivated, and many more people employed;
and consequently the tributes imposed by his Majesty can be all the
more easily collected, and from that time the royal exchequer will be
better filled; and the vassals, by being kept busy, become more
obedient and more loyal. The Spanish traders who are established there
are favored [by such policy]; for they obtain their profits on both the
exportation and the importation, and if one of these fail, the other
will be able to supply the deficiency; but the advantage will be the
greater if it can be obtained from both sources of gain. When commerce
is flourishing, his Majesty will obtain greater profits from the
customs duties, for which reason it is highly expedient that his
Majesty encourage the cultivation of the land and the increase of its
products&mdash;a thing which I do not <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb258" href="#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>consider difficult of
accomplishment, as I have already demonstrated in another little work,
which I have placed in the hands of the ministers.<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e7294src" href="#xd24e7294" name="xd24e7294src">7</a></p>
<p class="par">In order to demonstrate clearly how much the people of
Manila could avail themselves of the products of the land, I will
relate what occurred with myself (and it is a circumstance which proves
what I advanced in the second point), to wit: When I was at Manila the
exportation of sugar was rigorously prohibited, so that hardly could a
ship carry away enough for its own supply, [the authorities] telling
the vessel-owners that it was against the ordinances of his Majesty. I
remained for some time under this delusion, until I had carefully
examined the said ordinances, from which it was clear to me that his
Majesty had decreed everything in favor of his Indian vassals, and that
his royal will was, not to oppress them therein. It caused me, then,
much pain to see that this thing was so entirely misunderstood, since
this prohibition was diametrically opposed to it; for it forbade the
people to enjoy the benefits of the country which God had given them,
which the king never had intended to take away from
them&mdash;especially as this [commerce] is the only means that they
possess by which they can pay their tributes. Finally I undertook to
establish generally the exportation of sugar. Having been warned of the
difficulties, I went to the province where it<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7302src" href="#xd24e7302" name="xd24e7302src">8</a> greatly
abounds (which is called Pampanga), <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb259" href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>and did what I could;
it was agreed that I should make an experiment, in order to please his
Lordship. I consented, on the condition that a certain Don Francisco
Salgado, a careful and industrious man, should be appointed my
assistant; as I had not the time to execute this plan, I only gave him
all [necessary] information and instructions. At last we succeeded in
making indigo so good that it stood every test, the severest and most
certain that are known being those of water and of fire. I sent
specimens of that quality to China, the Coromandel coast, Persia, and
Londres [<i>i.e.</i>, London]; in the first three places they were
anxious to obtain it, and offered good prices, and in the last-named
one the indigo that had cost 500 reals vellon was sold for 2,600 reals.
They will be able to manufacture every year such quantity as they
desire.</p>
<p class="par">I believe that I have succeeded in what I undertook to
demonstrate, which is as follows: First, to make known the abundance of
the products of the Philipinas Islands; second, to prove from my own
experience that it is easy to secure the benefit of these; third, to
set forth the advantage and benefit which will accrue to his Majesty,
to the Spaniards settled in those regions, and to the Indian vassals
generally.</p>
<p class="par">I can say that charity has induced me to make known what
I have already related from my own experience, seeing that all that has
hitherto been written [on this subject] is very superficial; nor can
the most intelligent man form from those books a stable opinion of what
these islands are capable of yielding from their so abundant
products.</p>
<p class="par">This little work is condensed, but those who are capable
of comprehending it will see that it is [so] <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>on
account of being written out of thorough understanding and knowledge of
what I write about, and not for lack of a very broad field in which I
might descant, for it cannot be denied that there is material for
filling a volume.</p>
<p class="par">Nevertheless, I do not claim to lay down the law, nor do
I presume to change any system; my intention is only to depict things
as they are, in order that his Majesty may have actual knowledge of the
treasure which he possesses in these islands. No advantage results to
me, nor do I expect more than to be a man ready to communicate [what he
knows], and desirous to do what shall depend on a limited ability, for
the greater benefit of his Majesty and the advancement of his realms.
But it is already time that we show in what consists the advantage and
benefit which will accrue to his Majesty from the Philipinas
Islands.</p>
<p class="par">What precedes this serves only to demonstrate that the
Spaniards settled in Manila have a broad field for carrying on a
flourishing commerce, and even it would redound much to the advantage
of his Majesty. But what I am earnestly advocating is cinnamon, and it
is of great importance to his Majesty and worthy of his royal
attention; and if I say that no one has hitherto, or since
Espa&ntilde;a conquered the Philipinas, made a proposition so certain,
so well founded, and so advantageous to his Majesty, and to all his
dominions and his vassals, it is not much to say. For it is no
exaggeration when I say that it is more than the conquistador
accomplished; he succeeded, with honor and glory, in conquering the
islands, but they have always cost Espa&ntilde;a most dearly for their
maintenance. For not only do I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261"
href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span>aim to relieve those
expenses, which are so large, but those islands can in a few years
become a benefit to his Majesty, and to his vassals, both Spaniards and
Indians. I do not ask these gratuities,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7324src" href="#xd24e7324" name="xd24e7324src">9</a> nor that the
king should spend one maravedi; my chief object and desire is, that a
stable commerce be allowed from those countries to these kingdoms by
the most direct route.</p>
<p class="par">No one is ignorant of the vast amount of silver which
goes every year from Espa&ntilde;a to the Dutch for the supply of
cinnamon, for it is not less than many millions of pesos duros each
year, as they have estimated; but I affirm that this is because they
[<i>i.e.</i>, the Spaniards] are willing to let the silver go out [of
the country]. Espa&ntilde;a might with as good reason send to Olanda to
buy her wine as her cinnamon. I will not undertake to argue whence it
comes, although I know it very well. What I am trying to do, without
offending any one, is to remedy this lack which Espa&ntilde;a suffers,
that the Spaniards may use their good judgment and their reason and
become true patriots. What a pity it is that his Majesty, possessing so
noble a commodity, and being able to place it on the market&mdash;with
as good success as that of Ceyl&aacute;n, and even at less than half of
the price&mdash;should permit so many millions of silver to pass every
year from his dominions to the Dutch! which is to furnish that people
with arms for carrying on war when opportunity may offer. It is well
known that Espa&ntilde;a consumes more cinnamon than all the other
nations; can there, then, be greater folly? In order (as I suppose) to
humor the Dutch, Espa&ntilde;a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262"
href="#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>leaves unused the cinnamon
which she has in her own house, in order to buy it from those enemies
and the destroyers of the holy faith in those countries; I say that
this is opposed to the Christian religion, and I prove it in a few
words: if Espa&ntilde;a would avail herself of this product which she
could so easily dispose of, the Dutch could not maintain [their
establishments in] the island of Ceylon, and then Espa&ntilde;a could
even introduce missions in that island. But what foolish talk! The
Dutch maintain Ceilon? The Spaniards support it; they pay for its
ships, its fortresses, and its garrisons which the Dutch have
there&mdash;although in order to destroy these the Spaniards need
neither balls, nor gunpowder, nor war. If any one thinks that this is a
sweeping statement [<i lang="es">es adelantar mucho</i>], we are of
differing opinions, because to me it seems a moderate one.</p>
<p class="par">I am known as a man who has accomplished much, who has
traveled in many lands, and who has not passed through them heedlessly;
nor have I stopped to consider the expenditure of money, or the risk to
health, in order to satisfy my curiosity and obtain well grounded
knowledge of all things wherever I have traveled. To the point:
Samboanga, the capital of the island of Mindanao, is the place which
could produce cinnamon as good as that of Ceylon, if our people knew
how to cultivate it; I have already made the experiment, and it will
yield the amount that I shall require. The Dutch are well aware of
this, [as appears] by evidence which can be verified by me; for they,
with their trained and accustomed cunning, placed in the said island a
stone with the initial letters of [the name of] their company
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>engraved on it, like those which they are wont
to place in their bales of goods, etc., by way of manifesting that
these belong to the said company. The said stone was brought to Manila
while I was there, and was delivered to the Marques de Obando; and his
Lordship, knowing that I understood the tricks and policy of those
gentlemen, sent to call me, and, showing me the stone, he said,
&ldquo;What is the meaning of this stone, which they have brought to me
under such-and-such circumstances?&rdquo; I replied to his Lordship,
&ldquo;It is nothing; it is a mark which the Dutch are wont to set up
in order to have a pretext, when opportunity offers, for laying claim
to the lands in which they have placed the said stones.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7347src" href="#xd24e7347" name=
"xd24e7347src">10</a> No one, then, who understands that
people&mdash;keen, mercenary, and always on the watch&mdash;will fail
to agree with me, that they do not set up these stones in barren
islands, unless it is evident that, on account of the location of these
islands, it will not suit the Dutch to have [other people there as]
close neighbors. When they abandoned the island of Maurisius,
considering it uninhabitable on account of its sterility, they left no
engraved stone in it. It is a circumstance which deserves attention,
and is even <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=
"pb264">264</a>]</span>worthy of coming to his Majesty&rsquo;s
knowledge; and likewise those who have or have had practical knowledge
of these matters regard them in this way. Finally, I have compared the
quality of the soil at Samboanga with that of Ceylon, also the leaves
of the cinnamon tree; still more, I have gathered the bark of this tree
at Samboanga and made certain experiments with it, and when I compared
it with that from Ceylon they were of equal value. I consider, then,
[from] the manner of making these experiments with the cultivation of
the soil and the culture of the cinnamon, [that] it will prove to be
equal [to that of Ceylon]. Finally, in commencing the experiments which
I have made&mdash;with the greatest application and industry, and
enormous expenses&mdash;they are quite sufficient to prove that it will
be possible, in the term of five or six years, to produce a large part
of the best cinnamon which comes to Europa. This I have learned from
the experiment with a quantity of chocolate which I ordered to be made
in my own house at Manila; this product has been greatly liked by the
ladies, and by people of taste and understanding, in the said city.</p>
<p class="par">In view of these proofs, which I have from actual
knowledge of the method of cultivating and preparing this product, it
causes me surprise that his Majesty is losing a source of profit so
extensive and lucrative; and I am persuaded that if full knowledge of
them could have reached the officials who might have authority to
examine the subject, they would have taken suitable measures to secure
this benefit&mdash;although it is certain that it would not be
considered that no one hitherto has attained it [<i>i.e.</i>, such
knowledge] except that which is here explained <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span>by
myself, which is the simple truth. And as for what concerns my part, I
can serve, if desirable, in carrying out a work so national and so
advantageous to his Majesty&mdash;in which honor and fame spur me to
place myself at the disposal of his Majesty, without causing him the
expenditure of one real of silver; for, thanks to God, I have the means
for travel. Nevertheless, I shall never weary in the acquisition of the
precious treasures of honor and truth; for God only knows the exceeding
satisfaction which I feel in being the first and only person who has
had the good fortune to furnish this information, so clear and plain
that, if it were published to the world, I am sure that the rest of the
nations would conspire against me; for they know its great usefulness,
and the little difficulty which I would find in carrying out the
plan.</p>
<p class="par">I have been assured that the clove is found in Mindanao.
I have made every possible effort to investigate this, and I believe
that it is certainly so, although I cannot assert more than what
experience has taught me. But I can affirm with more certainty that the
nutmeg grows there, and needs only to be cultivated; also pepper of the
best quality, and most delicious, can be had in abundance. At present
the only thing left for us is to reflect upon the many advantages and
incredible benefits which will accrue to his Majesty, and to his
dominions and vassals, both Spaniards and Indians, without costing him
a real vellon to establish this commerce. The English and Dutch, on the
other hand, will spend millions to prevent the success of this great
project, for which reason it is evidently necessary to maintain the
utmost secrecy regarding it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href=
"#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span></p>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="xd24e7366">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><i>Recapitulation of the advantages and benefits of
this commerce</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">First: The millions of pesos duros which now pass
out of the domains of his Majesty, with which the Dutch are enriching
themselves and promoting their main commerce, that of the cinnamon;
they will have so much less for hostilities against Espa&ntilde;a, the
more that this matter of the cinnamon is pushed in that country, thus
rendering it impossible for them to carry away the silver thence.</p>
<p class="par">Second: Great numbers of Indians would be employed who
now have no way in which to make a living or to pay their tributes; by
this means not only would they be relieved [from their burdens], but it
would be with great increase to the royal exchequer; and through their
application and gains they would consequently be more faithful and
constant vassals, while now idleness and vices prevent them from being
such.</p>
<p class="par">Third: The Philipinas Islands are suffering severely
from the lack of communication by a direct route with Espa&ntilde;a;
this could be easily secured by arming the ships there, which need from
Espa&ntilde;a more people than a few officers; and it would be very
desirable to transport for those islands some artisans whom they will
need for promoting and cultivating the various products of the
land.</p>
<p class="par">Fourth: The more that the lands are cultivated and their
products made available, the greater will be the number of men and of
infidel Indians that will be needed; and consequently they will submit
[to Spanish authority], and be converted into loyal vassals and
friends, and Christianity will be increased <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span>in
those regions, without any fear that the Moro and infidel enemies can
disturb them.</p>
<p class="par">Fifth: It will be possible to equip every year three or
four ships of six hundred to a thousand toneladas each, and despatch
them for Europa with cinnamon, pepper, and other spices which will be
produced there; and in return they will go back with various
commodities and fruits, the products of Espa&ntilde;a, which the people
of Manila always find themselves compelled to buy from the English and
Dutch, carrying away the money for them. In this manner not only will
these gains remain within the dominions of his Majesty, without the
other nations being able to draw thence the money with which they carry
on war, [to the] injury of the commerce of Espa&ntilde;a, but by this
means the [Spanish] dominions that are so remote will come to be to a
large extent dependent one upon another; and as the intercourse between
them would be mutual and friendly, the Indians consequently would have
occasion to see and experience the greatness [of the Spanish power].
Thus they would come to be more faithful and loyal vassals, and
returning to their own lands, would influence their countrymen to be
the same.</p>
<p class="par">Sixth: No one will deny my statement that the cinnamon
would [thus] be obtained at a much less cost [by the Spaniards] than
that at which the Dutch can sell it, unless [they encounter] less risk
and danger&mdash;[which are] so manifest that for the preservation of
this commerce they find themselves compelled to maintain a great number
of troops and keep up many forts and garrisons, solely to defend
themselves. Let to all this be added the governors, and the enormous
number of people whom they have in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268"
href="#pb268" name="pb268">268</a>]</span>their service, with some very
large expenses which arise from the various opinions of the
companies&mdash;the costs of which, so ill applied, render the cinnamon
more expensive (although in reality its cost is low), and it is certain
that their commerce in spices does not prove to be so profitable as the
nations assert. Very differently, then, will it be in favor of
Espa&ntilde;a when she reaches the cultivation of the cinnamon; for in
place of the great expenses which his Majesty has had ever since he
took possession of the said island, without its producing any benefit,
he will obtain the greatest advantages without spending a real vellon
more than at present. Especially, labor will be found as cheap, and the
cultivation of the soil as easy, as in Ceylon; and the navigation can
be made with the same advantages that [other] nations [possess], or
even greater. For this reason the cinnamon will cost the merchants
forty or fifty per cent less than they have actually paid hitherto. It
is certain that it is a very serious damage which Espa&ntilde;a
generally suffers in her commerce, from paying, through this
negligence, the freight charges of the Dutch ships, and the cost of
their officers and seamen; and they even maintain their fortifications,
etc., with the money which they obtain from Espa&ntilde;a for this
product of cinnamon.</p>
<p class="par">Seventh: Likewise, there would be great advantage to
Espa&ntilde;a in the ships which would come from the Philipinas, as I
have said (in the fifth point); for they would return laden with many
fruits and products of these kingdoms of Espa&ntilde;a.</p>
<p class="par">Eighth: The Americans would likewise share in this great
benefit; for the cinnamon, for which they are today paying so
exorbitant a price, they would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269"
href="#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>obtain at very nearly the
same price at which it is usually sold in Cadiz.</p>
<p class="par">Ninth: If the cinnamon should become cheap, much
chocolate would be consumed by the poor; and consequently the duties
would amount to much more, to the advantage of his Majesty.</p>
<p class="par">Notwithstanding that the greatness of the enterprise is
clearly demonstrated, and no additional information is needed, two
things ought to be noted. First, that no damage or expense can result
to his Majesty. Second, that from this arrangement, it is evident and
positive, not the least injury or disadvantage ensues to Espa&ntilde;a
or to America; rather, it is a triple benefit, and
indispensable&mdash;which, [however,] without general experience and
practical knowledge it would be impossible to bring about without each
dominion injuring the other; for in this consists the superiority of a
man who is an expert.</p>
<p class="par">[The writer then proceeds to mention the spiritual
advantages which would result from the temporal; but his argument
becomes somewhat lame here, reducing itself to the &ldquo;hope that,
with the help of our Lord, a firm and permanent peace with the Moros
may be secured&rdquo; He makes an interesting statement regarding the
extent of the ravages committed by the Mindanao pirates: &ldquo;I am
certain, from accurate information, that during the government of the
Marqu&eacute;s de Obando he cost the king eight millions of reals
vellon [for this purpose], although he proceeded with the utmost
economy and care in the manner in which he used the royal revenue; and,
having made in the year 1755 a calculation of the expenses which these
piracies were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span>causing to his Majesty and his vassals (both
Spaniards and Indians) from the ravages made by the Moros and infidels
during the eight years preceding, it amounted to about eighty millions
of reals vellon,&rdquo; not to mention the killing of priests and
native Christians. Of course, if peace is secured with the Moros, the
progress and extension of the missions in the islands is assured. The
writer again declares his devotion to the service of God and the king,
his readiness to explain his plans further to those who desire more
information, and his confidence that they will command the confidence
of men of understanding, judgment, and patriotism.]</p>
<p class="par">Although through experience (<i lang="la">tempus edrax
rerum</i>) one can come to know the utility and advantage which will
accrue from the execution of this so vast enterprise, I trust that I
have demonstrated it quite sufficiently to render it worthy of the
consideration of his Majesty; nevertheless, seeing how much is
involved, it is fitting for my honor to furnish proofs, the most
detailed and circumstantial. This induces me to quote part of the
lading which came in seventeen ships of the Company of Olanda, as
published in the <i>Gazette</i> of Amsterdam, dated on July 3 of this
present year, one thousand seven hundred and fifty-nine&mdash;products
which are and may be those of the very islands in question; and in
order to show how very important it is to give attention to what is
herein proposed, each commodity is valued at the regular price which it
can bring in the ports of Cadiz, Alicante, etc. <span class=

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">I have taken into consideration the objections which may
be brought forward by persons who are little acquainted with trade, and
these are reduced, substantially, to the following: That the
consumption of these commodities in the dominions of his Majesty cannot
be regulated by the above calculation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb272" href="#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span>They speak glibly;
but, in order not to lose time with these persons, I answer them, that
one is compelled to encounter ignorance, but the only concern of great
souls is to serve faithfully their kings and nations, and endure the
calumnies which are uttered against honest men&mdash;imitating the
stars, which, no matter how much the dogs bark, do not cease to shine
down upon them and to follow their own courses. Accordingly, let us
proceed to truths which are plain:</p>
<p class="par">First: that the Dutch carry these commodities in large
quantities, as is above stated&mdash;a proof that there is a
consumption for that amount, and that this is a profitable trade.
Second: that the calculation which I have made cannot be defective,
since the [amounts of the] commodities agree with the figures published
by the Dutch themselves; and the prices are obtained from the Company
of Druggists, in accordance with what they pay for the goods at the
ports. Third: that the greater part [of these commodities], and the
most important ones, if not [all], can be the products of the
Philipinas Islands. Fourth: that these commodities must cost much less
than in Olanda, or in any other country, is manifest and undeniable for
this reason, that the Dutch are obliged to incur enormous
expenses&mdash;for governors, members of council, lesser servants
without number, and many troops&mdash;in order to maintain their
establishments; and these expenses increase just so much the prices of
their spices, so that, if they buy these from the [Eastern] nations at
ten, the goods are worth to them twenty-five. This would not occur with
us, because the king does not need to increase the expenses in order to
secure the advancement of the islands. It would be entirely different;
for, if <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span>these plantations are established, thousands of
Indians who now are suffering the utmost poverty without having any
opportunity to work, and for the same reason cannot pay their tributes,
would have a means of gaining their living and of paying their
tributes, and on this very account it would serve much for the increase
of the royal revenue.</p>
<p class="par">As these Indians are not paid for their labor at higher
rates than are those among whom the Dutch reside, we must reckon, for
the reasons here stated, that those same commodities would cost much
less, and that the Spaniards could sell them at lower prices than do
the Dutch; and, as the merchant in every country buys where he will
find his greatest advantage, Espa&ntilde;a would be the fair for these
commodities which have already enriched so many nations. But let us
proceed to reveal the cunning of the Dutch, who furnish only three
millions, seven hundred and fifty thousand, eight hundred and forty
libras of cinnamon&mdash;which, at the rate of sixteen onzas a libra,
make six<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7584src" href="#xd24e7584" name=
"xd24e7584src">12</a> millions, thirteen thousand, four hundred and
forty onzas. The rule for making chocolate is to take ten libras of
cacao, ten of sugar, and eight onzas of cinnamon, or even less, and on
account of the waste<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7587src" href=
"#xd24e7587" name="xd24e7587src">13</a> it is computed that the result
will be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>twenty libras net; consequently, from the three
millions, seven hundred and fifty thousand, eight hundred and forty
libras of cinnamon could be made <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275"
href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>fifteen millions,
thirty-three thousand, six hundred libras of chocolate.</p>
<p class="par">Although it is folly to make such a proposition, I ask
whether there are not in Espa&ntilde;a,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7622src" href="#xd24e7622" name="xd24e7622src">14</a> all
America, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>the Philipinas Islands, and, in short, all the
so various domains of his Majesty, counting all these together, four
millions of persons who drink chocolate sixty-four times in the year,
in accordance with the rule of one onza for each time. Even the most
ignorant or malicious person will not deny my proposition; this makes,
then, the consumption of chocolate sixteen millions of libras, and for
making it there will be needed four hundred thousand libras of
cinnamon.</p>
<p class="par">Hence are drawn two conclusions. One is, the extreme
craftiness of the Dutch, in not furnishing more than the said quantity
in order to supply the Spaniards, and in making them believe that they
will be left without chocolate; and thus they succeed in obliging the
Spaniards to pay for the cinnamon at the very high prices which the
Dutch have fixed in these recent years&mdash;for it is a hundred per
cent more costly, and fifty per cent worse in quality; therefore there
is an increase of a hundred and fifty per cent in favor of the Dutch,
and of three hundred per cent to the injury of Espa&ntilde;a, who
without reason endures this tyranny. Therefore, if the Dutch are not
mistaken in the estimate of cinnamon which they published in the
<i>Gazette</i>, and as the consumption [of that spice] in Espa&ntilde;a
is as I have made evident, there will not be cinnamon to supply all the
nations; nevertheless, there will be no lack of it in any of
them.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7635src" href="#xd24e7635" name=
"xd24e7635src">15</a></p>
<p class="par">Second: since it is so evident that in the dominions of
his Majesty there is consumed in [the beverage <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span>of]
chocolate alone (without counting the numerous kinds of food in which
use is made of it) sixteen millions of libras, and in order to make it
there are needed four hundred thousand of cinnamon, at the rate of
fifty-eight reals vellon that quantity will cost twenty-three millions,
three hundred thousand reals vellon, which is the least that
Espa&ntilde;a could advance for the execution of the project. Moreover,
I do not know any reason for not admitting the commodity of
pepper&mdash;which not only is so exceedingly abundant in the islands,
but I persuade myself that, since it is so excellent in its crude
state, it would with skilful treatment be better than that of any
[other] country. It is also plain to us that the Dutch bring [to
Europa] four millions, six hundred and seventy-two thousand, seven
hundred and forty-six libras of it; they assure me that only because of
the great abundance of garlic<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7642src" href=
"#xd24e7642" name="xd24e7642src">16</a> in Espa&ntilde;a the pepper
brings no more than seven reals vellon a libra&mdash;[at which rate]
the above quantity will amount to thirty-two millions, seven [hundred]
and nine thousand, two hundred and twenty-two reals vellon. This added
to the twenty-three millions, three hundred thousand reals [for
cinnamon] will make fifty-six millions, nine thousand, two hundred and
twenty-two reals vellon.</p>
<p class="par">People will say, &ldquo;Where would we consume so much
pepper?&rdquo; Then where does Olanda consume it, I would like to know?
&ldquo;[And there are] Francia and Inglaterra; do they bring much less
[to Europa]?&rdquo; Do not those who ask such questions <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name="pb278">278</a>]</span>know
how much the king is paying to Norbega [<i>i.e.</i>, Norway] and the
northern countries for lumber, cordage, etc., for the construction in
his royal navy? and that, if it happens that care is not given in time
to the planting of oak groves, he will need much more [from those
countries]?&mdash;At present these commodities are paid for in ready
money, which would not be the case if we could give the merchants there
the pepper, etc., so cheaply (or at less expense than [if purchased
from] another country), on account of the great consumption of pepper
which there is in those countries, and because this would be a [form
of] trade that is mutually advantageous, as I have already said, for
the day-laborer and the shepherd. It would be permanent, and many
millions of reals which now leave Espa&ntilde;a would remain here, to
the greatest advantage not only of his Majesty, but of his vassals. I
say, then, that no one is able to deny these two propositions, of which
his Majesty will be best able to judge. Have I heard some one argue
that Espa&ntilde;a has<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7658src" href=
"#xd24e7658" name="xd24e7658src">17</a> need of preventing thus the
exportation of silver? Such arguments are foolish, and one should laugh
at them.</p>
<p class="par">Do we not know that Olanda commands that a very large
part of the spice product be burned and destroyed, in order that a
commodity which brings her so enormous a profit should not, through its
excessive abundance, contribute to her loss? I say, then, that if
Espa&ntilde;a reaches an excessive abundance of silver, it would be far
better for the king to command that the mines be closed, or to fling
the silver into the sea, than to let it pass into the hands of those
who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>tomorrow can avail themselves of it to carry on
war [against Espa&ntilde;a]. Others I have heard talk [on this
subject], so frivolously that I was astounded, hinting at the
resentment of this other nation if Espa&ntilde;a should profit by what
is her own&mdash;that is, the execution of the proposition [that I have
made]. That is the same as to say that Inglaterra or any other nation
could declare that Espa&ntilde;a shall not cultivate the ground or sow
the wheat, because it suited that nation to supply it; it is to talk
very heedlessly, without knowing that Espa&ntilde;a can limit the
commerce of Francia, Inglaterra, and Olanda whenever she desires,
without cannon-ball or gunpowder, by the prohibition of silver alone.
If she chooses to deprive any one of those countries of this advantage,
she has only to calculate what she owes to the other two for the net
balance of their trade, and then not allow any more silver to go out to
those countries; and these, needing it for themselves, will not be able
to supply the other one. I can assert that Espa&ntilde;a, if she would
avail herself of the rights which God has given her, would make herself
more worthy of respect by depriving the [other] nations of what is
essential, not only for their commerce, but for waging war to
advantage.</p>
<p class="par">I believe that no one will dispute the advantages and
benefit which can accrue from the Philipinas Islands, and it is this
which from the outset I have attempted to demonstrate, although I omit,
for the sake of brevity, the explanation of many things.</p>
<p class="par">Keeping in mind how much I owe to the infinite mercy and
goodness of supreme Providence, in the second part of the work alluded
to, which I presume to present to his Majesty, I have treated at length
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>of the ravages which the Moros have committed
during very many years in those islands, and of the exceeding damage
which they thus cause to our holy Roman Catholic and apostolic faith,
for I cannot do less. Indeed, it is evident that God has assisted me
with His divine Grace; and therefore I certainly ought to defend and,
if it should be necessary, die for His cause. Accordingly, in whatever
concerns the subjection of the Moros, and consequently the protection
and advancement of the holy faith in those islands, I hope to deserve
that his Majesty will do me the honor of appointing six
lieutenant-commanders&mdash;three from his royal navy, and three from
his army&mdash;in order that they may examine with the utmost care the
plan upon which I have based my proposition, giving their opinions in
writing for presentation to his Majesty, in two copies, one for his
Majesty&rsquo;s royal Council of the Indias, the other for myself.</p>
<p class="par">When this examination shall be made, and the plan
approved by the king if such be his royal will, I will immediately
proceed to furnish the plan of the whole matter which I have drawn up
for the execution of the project&mdash;from which, after further
investigations (which are very just, and perhaps will be quite
unprecedented) his Majesty can more easily decide what shall be most
expedient in this matter, as also the selection of persons for the said
purpose.</p>
<p class="par">As for what pertains to the commerce, for greater
certainty I deemed it expedient to communicate my intention to Don
Antonio Butlert [<i>sic</i>], formerly a merchant of Cadiz&mdash;since
he is distinguished not only for his great success in business and his
genuine friendship to this nation, but by his long experience in and
thorough knowledge of the commerce of these <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span>dominions&mdash;asking him to give me his
disinterested opinion on the subject, in which he should consider with
the utmost attention the general welfare of these dominions; and this
opinion I have, in writing, and signed with the name of his firm, which
reads &ldquo;Butlert and Matheos.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Some persons who are little acquainted with affairs so
vast, and who have still less ability to make ready for the great
things which remain to be done, will suppose that the execution [of
this plan] is easy, to one who has the writings which I have already
furnished; nevertheless, if they engaged in the undertaking they would
find themselves much mistaken, and the result would be greatly to the
detriment of the nation.</p>
<p class="par">Warned by what I have passed through, and dreading [the
effects of] ignorance and malice, I have reached the decision to
supplicate the king to grant me the honor of this
examination&mdash;desiring, whatever may fall to my lot, to prove that
I have no other purpose than to serve faithfully both Majesties and
their vassals, and entreating them for this end to dispose of my life
and person, of which I will gladly make sacrifice in proof of my
loyalty and sincere devotion.</p>

islands and Cadiz, by way of the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Conditions.</i>&mdash;That he shall be permitted to
undertake the said route from Cadiz, or may go to the said islands and
make the voyage from there to Cadiz, as he shall find most convenient.
If he shall set out from Cadiz, on account of not having time to build
ships he shall be permitted to buy whatever vessels [he may need],
without excepting those of foreigners. The cargo from Cadiz must
consist of different fruits, liquids,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7697src" href="#xd24e7697" name="xd24e7697src">18</a> and
commodities that are products of Espa&ntilde;a and of her commerce, as
on the return voyage it must be from the various products and
commodities of the said islands and of their commerce. That his Majesty
remit the duties for the first voyage, and that the proponent be
permitted to embark freely at Cadiz the silver that he needs to defray
the purchase of his return cargo. On the second voyage he shall pay at
Cadiz not only the five per cent duties but the three per cent of the
silver which he shall thereafter embark, as is done with the [traders
of foreign] nations. In order to obviate any objection, he will not
enter any port belonging to his Majesty or to any power of Europa; he
shall, however, be permitted to enter and anchor at any one of the
Indian ports, whether in these or in those seas, and therein buy, sell,
exchange, or lade the goods which shall be offered to him.</p>
<p class="par">The advantages, etc., will be the following: His Majesty
will not subject his royal revenue to any expense, nor will it be
exposed to the evil designs of men, or to the doubtful patriots who
pretend to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span>have knowledge. There is no treaty that can be
set against him, as he can prove. By the most moderate computation, the
Dutch annually export four millions of pesos for the spice-trade; this,
therefore, is to make them powerful, to the injury of Espa&ntilde;a.
Norvega, St. Petersbourgh, and other countries demand a great amount of
cash for lumber, pitch, cordage, sails, etc., for the royal
shipbuilding, the greater part of which would be paid for in spices, as
these are greatly liked in those countries. Equivalent injury to
Espa&ntilde;a, as is stated above.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7707src"
href="#xd24e7707" name="xd24e7707src">19</a> The commodities and
products of Espa&ntilde;a would have a much larger market. A strong
stimulus to the cultivation of the soil. His Majesty would experience
much relief in the expenses of transportation for the missions. This
navigation would serve as a nursery for the navy, as is found by
experience in other countries. The direct communication would serve as
a check on a thousand abuses, not only in the government of the
islands, but in other matters. If his Majesty should grant this
privilege to the said islands, it would be most just that the
commonwealth of Manila should carry on its commerce with Acapulco at
its own cost, without laying the burden of it on his Majesty. By not
possessing this commerce when she can have it, Espa&ntilde;a is
maintaining thousands of strangers in place of a like number of her own
vassals; [the latter would] redound to the increase of the royal
revenue, and in the course of years to the propagation of the holy
faith. The Moros, who now are by their wars destroying the felicitous
progress of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>the Christian religion, when they found by
experience how much more it suited their own interests to maintain
peace and commerce with the Spaniards than to wage war against them,
would inviolably observe their treaties; for, notwithstanding the
cruelties which the Dutch practice against their Indians, the latter
tolerate them on account of the advantages of their commerce. The
people of Manila will, when they have a market for their products,
cultivate the land; they will establish family estates, and enrich
themselves; and their riches, like those of the Americans, will finally
come to Espa&ntilde;a. The duties which your Majesty would receive from
this new commerce would in a very few years amount to very considerable
sums. It would be a stimulus to other new commercial undertakings,
which would be beneficial to his Majesty and his vassals.</p>

&ldquo;By the marriage with Elizabeth Farnese (ancestry normal), Philip
V had, as an heir, Charles III, of Spain, who was the best of the more
modern sovereigns of that country&mdash;in fact, the only normal one
since before the days of the Emperor Charles V, now seven generations
in the background. Not that Charles III inherited any of the ancient
genius, for that had gone, never to appear again. He was, however, ([to
cite] Hume), &lsquo;an enlightened, generous, and just king and a noble
and magnanimous man,&rsquo; and (Rose&rsquo;s <i>Biographical
Dictionary</i>) &lsquo;possessed abilities as a monarch, and virtues as
a private citizen, ... was a popular sovereign and a great economist of
time, scrupulously methodical in all his operations.&rsquo;&rdquo; Thus
writes Dr. F. A. Woods, in his <i>Heredity in Royalty</i> (New York,
1906), pp. 155, 156&mdash;a book which endeavors, on scientific lines,
to ascertain the influence of heredity as displayed in the royal
families of Europe. The chapter on the rulers of Spain is found at pp.
124&ndash;171. He says (p. 138): &ldquo;The origin of the well-known
insanity in the Spanish and Austrian houses, perpetuated over thirteen
generations and involving more than a score of individuals, is a very
interesting question. It cannot be traced with certainty prior to
Isabella, the Queen of John II, of Castile. This Isabella was out and
out insane, according to the English alienist, W. W. Ireland; and from
her, onward, the insanity passed along in one form or another by the
very intermarriages which their pride and political motives caused them
to arrange, with the intended idea of making permanent their world
power, but with the inevitable result of losing that same prestige by
placing it in the hands of the unfortunate children whose inheritance
was necessarily mental weakness as the result of such unwise
wedlocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par footnote cont">For account of Carlos III&rsquo;s reign,
see Manuel Danvila y Collado&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Reinado de Carlos
III</i> (Madrid, 1894). An interesting description of this
monarch&rsquo;s character and mode of life may be found in the
<i>Dublin Magazine</i> for April, 1763, pp. 238, 239; it is written by
a clergyman named Clark, &ldquo;chaplain to the Earl of Bristol, late
ambassador at the court of Madrid.&rdquo; He says, among other things:
&ldquo;He is the greatest Nimrod of his time: he sacrifices everything
to this favorite pleasure; he was disgusted at his public entry,
because it <span class="corr" id="xd24e7179" title=
"Source: hindred">hindered</span> him of four days sport. He stayed
three days at Toledo, and killed six wild mountain-cats, which, as I
was well informed by those who had calculated the expence of that
expedition, cost him exactly 1000 l. a cat.&rdquo; &ldquo;It has been
imagined that he is a very weak prince, and of little or no
understanding: Ir is a great mistake; he has some parts, but is mulish
and obstinate to the last degree; and, by being constantly flattered,
he imagines that he has more understanding than he really possesses. He
is reserved beyond the common reserve of princes, has no confidant, and
communicates his will only by his orders to put into execution. He can
neither be led nor driven; all must come from himself.&rdquo; &ldquo;He
allows no minister to remonstrate or argue with him.&rdquo; &ldquo;He
arrested and banished the inquisitor-general, and sent him prisoner to
a convent. He engaged in the present war with England, contrary to the
sentiments of his ministers, and in direct opposition to the voice of
the whole nation.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

Concepci&oacute;n mentions this stone (<i lang="es">Hist. de

they had marked &ldquo;a stone with the letter T, which, as it was
interpreted, signified, &lsquo;annexed to Terrenate.&rsquo; This same
token they had placed in other uninhabited islands in the vicinity.
This marked stone was dug up by the sultan of Mindanao, who sent it to
the governor of Samboangan, Don Pedro Zacharias. Two Dutch chalupas
went to call the Mindanaos to account for this act, intending to obtain
satisfaction for it by placing the marked stone in the locality of
Silangan, on the mainland of Mindanao; but Radiamura courageously drove

&ldquo;In 1618, according to the testimony of Dr. Marrad&oacute;n, of
Marchena, to one hundred cacao-beans must be added a pound and a half
of sugar, two onzas of cinnamon, fourteen grains of Mexican pepper, a
half-onza of cloves, and two reals&rsquo; weight of anise and annotto;
and one might add almonds, nuts, and orange-flower water. Years
afterward Dr. Colmenero of Ledesma modified this formula, making the
paste in the proportion of one hundred cacao-beans, one-half libra of
sugar, two granos of pepper, anise, cloves, Alexandrian [<i>i.e.</i>,
white] roses, logwood, cinnamon, almonds, nuts, and a sufficient
quantity of annotto to give it color.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par footnote cont">Until the end of the eighteenth century
chocolate was prepared mainly by hand-labor. &ldquo;In the seventeenth
century, the preparation of the chocolate was made by artisans, who
received twelve reals and an <i lang="es">azumbre</i> [<i>i.e.</i>,
about half a gallon] of wine for preparing each day the portion of
chocolate from sixteen libras of clear cacao. The chocolate, thus
prepared and sold under the name of &lsquo;health chocolate,&rsquo;
often contained special ingredients, chosen on account of the fashion,
or of the taste of the consumers; and if in those times great praise
was given to the chocolate which contained aromatic
essences&mdash;vanilla, amber, and orange&mdash;certainly not less
famous on that account was the chocolate of Madrid with its doradilla
[<i>i.e.</i>, ceterach], that of &Aacute;vila with its piment&oacute;n
[<i>i.e.</i>, a large variety of pepper], and that of Pamplona with its
pepper and ginger. Fray Manuel Ordo&ntilde;ez says, referring to the
paste which we are considering, that &lsquo;in the past century it was
sold only in the apothecary shops, like physicians&rsquo;
prescriptions, for our cure;&rsquo; and from this citation we may infer
not only that chocolate was regarded as a special medicine, but that it
was considered as a therapeutic agent, worthy of being kept by the
pharmacists of the seventeenth century. Later, in the eighteenth
century, the preparation of chocolate began to be made by the guild of
spice-dealers, its ingredients being reduced to the cacao, cinnamon or
vanilla, and sugar; and the custom became somewhat general of adding to
the paste some biscuit-dough, in order to make it thicker when it was
diluted with water. At the same time when the &lsquo;health
chocolate&rsquo; was sold in the spice-shops, a medicinal chocolate was
prepared in the apothecary shops, in which the principal products of
the pharmacopeia entered as ingredients. As the preparation of
chocolate had become general in the convents, in attempting to compete
with the spice-dealers the friars did not think of making it of better
quality; but, in order to sell it more cheaply, they subtracted from
cacao and cinnamon what they added in ingredients that were not always
harmless for the parishioner&rsquo;s health. In order that the
importance of this adulteration may be estimated, it is sufficient to
cite some of the additions most used, as wheat flour, rice flour;
ground lentils, peas, beans, and maize; starch, potato starch, and
dextrine; olive oil, sweet almond oil, yolk of egg, tallow of veal and
mutton; storax, chestnut [flour], gum tragacanth; cinnabar, red oxide
of mercury, red lead, carbonate of lime, etc.&rdquo; The manufacture of
chocolate has been conducted almost entirely by machinery during the
past century, and has accordingly thrown out the majority of the
artisans who made it by hand. (Jos&eacute; del Carmenal, cited in
Gr&auml;fenberg&rsquo;s <i lang="de">Spanisches Lesebuch</i>,

end of the atlas volume in Raynal&rsquo;s <i lang=
"fr">&Eacute;tablissemens et commerce des Europ&eacute;ens</i> is a
tabular &ldquo;Enumeration of the population of Spain, prepared in 1768
by order of his Lordship Conde de Aranda, president of the Council of
Castilla.&rdquo; The population is given separately for each of the
eight archbishoprics (which contain 48 bishoprics, 2 of them
&ldquo;exempt&rdquo;). The lay population was thus classed: married
persons, 1,724,567 men and 1,714,505 women; unmarried (presumably
including children), 2,809,069 boys and 2,911,858 girls; total,
9,159,999. Add the number of the clergy (both regular and secular),
which was 147,805, and the entire population numbered 9,307,804. Two
curious discrepancies may be noted: the number of married men is
greater than that of the married women by 10,062, and the girls exceed
the boys by 102,789 (this latter an excess of about 3&#8532; per cent).
The only region in which the number of married men is practically the
same as that of married women is the archdiocese of Valencia, and the
only one where the same thing is true of the boys and girls is the
archdiocese of Zaragoza. The greatest discrepancy in the numbers of
both these classes is found in the archdiocese of Burgos, where there
were 197,064 married men, and only 185,997 married women; and it had
330,428 girls and only 310,545 boys. Highly significant is the
enumeration of the privileged classes, of whom in the total population
there were 846,657, thus classified: those enjoying royal privileges,
89,393; in the department of finances, 27,577; in that of the Crusade,
4,248; in that of the Inquisition, 2,645; in the nobility, 722,794. It
is to be observed that three-fourths of all the privileged class are
found in the archdiocese of Burgos and the two exempt
bishoprics&mdash;in the former, 324,661; in the latter, 306,378. Not
less interesting are the statistics of the ecclesiastical estate. In
the 16,427 cities and villages were 18,106 parishes, which were served
by 15,641 curas. There were 2,004 monasteries, containing 55,453
religious; and 1,026 convents with 26,465 nuns. All these religious
orders employed also 8,552 persons as procurators and treasurers, and
with the orders were affiliated 26,294 laymen. In the service of the
churches were 25,248 laymen; and besides the curas there were 50,246
chaplains and beneficed priests. The total of all these items is
147,805, the number above given.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The very reverend father, Fray Baltazar de Santa
Cruz, prior-provincial of this province of Santo <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>Rossario of the Order of Preachers in these
Philipinas Islands, having visited the villages (which we have today
united and their inhabitants reduced to the said villages) and us two
ministers who for the space of nine months have been busied in the
reduction of said Indians, said reverend father provincial ordered me
to write a treatise on the site whence we have drawn the Indians whom
we have reduced, their customs, and mode of living.</p>
<p class="par">In order that the evangelical ministers who have to work
in this mission may be able more clearly to direct those souls redeemed
by the blood of our Lord Christ along the true pathway of heaven from
which they have strayed so far for so many years blinded with the
darkness of infidelity and idolatry; also in order that this paper may
be used so that the ministers of justice of the king, our sovereign,
may subject said Indians and establish them under the obedience of his
Catholic Majesty: although it is true that for more than sixty years
they had ministers of the gospel, neither said ministers nor his
Majesty have been able to succeed in getting them to live in a
settlement so that they may be administered or have justice as today it
is hoped that they will be. The most that it has been possible to
obtain with them was that distinct bands of them should unite on
various occasions in the mountain on the plateau where the ministers
had a house and church. But they immediately <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>broke up again, said division occasioning the
wars which those Indians generally wage among their different bands,
and the alcaldes-mayor were unable to punish the guilty and
ungovernable because of the greater distance from the chief cities
where the alcaldes-mayor live to these places, and because the coast of
the sea is so rough during all the time of the vendavals and south
winds, that it is impossible to navigate along it, while the road
overland is so rough and blocked by mountains full of black enemies
(those mountains being very rough in parts), and in the ravines there
are very great rivers with very strong currents, so that in the rainy
season one can have no communication from this place, with Pangasinan,
or with Mariueles, or with Pampanga; and during the dry season these
Indians are generally with the blacks in the mountains trading wax:
consequently, they have never been obedient to the alcaldes-mayor, and
hence, neither to his Majesty nor to the gospel ministers whom they
have hitherto had. Although they have had ministers of great virtue and
most ardent zeal for souls, as can be seen in the annals of their
sacred order and even today, there are ex-provincials who have been
their ministers whose signal virtues are apparent to all the
community.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><i>Of the site and district of Playa Honda</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Playa Honda begins at the doors of Mariueles and
extends along the mountains which border Pampanga to the point of Sunga
and near Pangasinan, which is distant more than forty leguas from
Mariueles to the visita of the Christian Baga Indians who are
administered by the minister of Mariueles. They perform their duties
toward the Church every <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href=
"#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span>year, notwithstanding that they
show very many imperfections, a fact which is not surprising, since the
minister cannot be with them all the time that he would like, as the
coast is inaccessible all the time of the vendavals. During that time
they must necessarily live without a minister to instruct them. That
visita has thirty tributes. Although they have a village laid out with
its church and house for the minister, they do not live in the said
village except when the minister goes to visit them. They live in their
rancher&iacute;as whence they get molave wood in abundance. They have
sufficient fields in said village for all, and for twice as many more
if they cared to cultivate them, but they apply themselves more
earnestly in cutting said timber than in farming their fields. They get
considerable help for [cutting] said wood from the blacks of the
mountain, for those blacks are excellent woodsmen. All those blacks are
tributary and pay twelve reals annually for their tribute. The tribute
is managed by the Indians, and the encomendero does not meddle with
them in the collection of the tribute from the blacks, but the Indians
pay the said tribute for the blacks. Hence the black serves the Indian
all the year, without the black having other profit at the end of the
year than his tribute paid. This is the reason why the village is
continually without people, because the Indians, on account of the
profit from the work of the blacks, go to live with the blacks, or near
the pass of the mountain, where said blacks live, in order to assist
them in the work, for the blacks unless assisted physically do not
work. Four leguas from this visita toward the north is another visita
called Mariyumo, administered also by the said father minister of
Mariueles. Its people <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href=
"#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>are Christians, although very bad
ones, and seriously lacking in the faith, and have very many
imperfections. They have very many superstitions and are much given to
omens. Not all of them are very fit to receive the annual communion.
They also have a village laid out and a church and house for the
minister. However, they do not live in the said village, but in their
rancher&iacute;as, much divided among themselves as are those of Baga;
although they are not such absolute masters of the blacks as are those
of Vaga, they also have blacks under trust on which account they
receive many vexations from the encomendero, for it is the regular
thing for them to pay the tribute for the blacks. The latter are more
free than the blacks of Vaga, for they have more land where they can
spread out, which those of Vaga do not have. Those Indians also possess
considerable molave timber, but they are lazier than the Indians of
Vaga. Consequently, there is no one to cut the wood unless the
corregidor of the island who administers justice to them, forces them
to cut said wood. It would be doing a great service to God to unite the
latter Indians with those of Baga, so that our holy Catholic faith
might be well administered to them. They number about forty tributes,
and, if they are united with those of Vaga, they can have a minister in
residence where they will be well administered, and where they have
lands sufficient for their farming, and timber in abundance. In such
case there would not be so great a scarcity of that product in the city
of Manila.</p>
<p class="par">One legua from Mariyumo begins the bay which lies back
of the mountains of Abucay and Samal, where we commenced to get the
Indians whom we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294"
name="pb294">294</a>]</span>have collected in this Nuevo Toledo. The
said bay has plenty of fish. Its mouth is about one legua wide, and is
closed by a small island surrounded by many reefs on the southern side,
but on the north it is very deep&mdash;so that any sized ship can enter
even when laden. But the said bay has no port and lies in the course of
all the vendaval and the south winds. It is five leguas long stretching
toward the east, and as many wide. Along all that bay, which it will
take two days to coast, were scattered twenty-two families, who are
today living in this village of Nuevo Toledo where they have their
houses and fields. Having passed the said bay and entered the mountain,
one legua inland in the mountain, one enters a very level and long
plain. One-half legua inland in the plain, is situated the first
village called Nuevo Toledo. That plain is six leguas wide and eight
long. It is bounded on the east by some very rough mountains which lie
between the province of Pampanga and that plain; at the foot of those
mountains were the rancher&iacute;as of Balacbac, which has fourteen
families; Lacnipan which had seven; Sigle which had fourteen more;
Aglao which had thirty-three. All those families were scattered, so
that in no rancher&iacute;a did five families live together. The sea
properly called Playa Honda bathes its western coast. On the sea-coast
were thirty-six families of very pernicious Indians, all of whom we
collected into the village of Santa Rossa de Banguen, where they
possess their houses and fields. Those Indians were scattered along the
creeks and <i lang="es">carrizals</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7835src" href="#xd24e7835" name="xd24e7835src">3</a> near the
sea, along six leguas of coast and level land beyond the plain running
toward the north two leguas. At the foot of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>some
very rough mountains between the sea and Buquil, there were fourteen
other families whom we have also collected in said village of Santa
Rossa de Banguen, which today consists of fifty families. That said
village of Santa Rossa is six leguas from that of Nuevo Toledo over a
stretch of level land in which there is a very great abundance of game.
Many were supported by that and had no fields and wherever they caught
the deer or carabao they stayed there until they finished eating it.
But at present they possess their gardens in the village, and since
care is taken in this, they will not be lazy, and will live in the
village where, having their gardens and the food from them, they will
not have so great need of the hunt. Six leguas farther on in another
site called Nalso, a plain where are stationed the presidio and fort of
Pinauen in a corner of said plain at the foot of the mountains of
Buquil, was a little village of about forty families, which the very
reverend father, Fray Joseph de la Sant&iacute;sima Trinidad,
ex-provincial of his order, had collected in said district. There were
there, moreover, twelve families who had recently descended the
mountains of Buquil, whom, since they were far from the fields, and the
flight to the mountains was very near and five families had returned to
the mountains, and there was no assurance of the others if left in said
site, we transferred to the visita of Alalam, which is now composed of
eighty families. The latter place is seven leguas from the village of
Santa Rossa de Banguen. Those who have had most difficulty have been
the thirty-three families whom we moved from the site and district of
Aglao, as they were very wild Indians, and little or not at all
softened until the present, and said <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb296" href="#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>site is distant six
leguas from the village of Nuevo Toledo where we stationed it. Three
leguas of the road are very bad, and there is not a drop of water to be
found for four leguas, during all the dry season. The road is over
sandy ground which is very large and full of rocks left by the river
which flows from the mountain of Pinatuba; and in those places where
there are no rocks, but only the sand, the road is also very wearisome
because that sand has no cohesion, and the least wind that blows lifts
the dust which blinds the travelers and has thus cost the greatest
hardship to those of this district who take that road in going and
coming between the village and the mountain. In the month of January of
this year of eighty, we had them all ready in the village, and I,
taking them to the mountain so that they might bring down their
possessions and rice to the village, and each family having brought
down five baskets of rice, one-half the distance along the road, more
than half of the people fell sick, because of the great labor which it
cost them to pass the said sandy ground. On that account I ordered them
to abandon their rice and possessions and to bring it down little by
little, and in order that they might make their gardens before the
season should expire, and so that they might finish their houses. They
have already finished them, and their gardens are at a
musket-shot&rsquo;s distance from the village, according to the edict
which Governor Don Juan de Vargas Hurtado, knight of the habit of
Santiago, changed for them for that purpose. Even in these slight
things, his Lordship has been active on account of his so great desire
that the Indians be reduced and be reasonable, if we may so say, for as
will be seen in their customs in which they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span>have
been reared until the present, they were wandering very far from
nationality and civilization.</p>
<p class="par">The village of Nuevo Toledo was composed of more than
one hundred families, and that of Santa Rossa de Banguen, of fifty, in
the month of January of this year 1680. All declared themselves before
Adjutant Alonso Martinez Franco, superior commandant of the fort of
Paynauen. The latter, at the evident risk of his life, and with the
continual watchfulness and zeal of a fervent religious, without heeding
his own interest which he would have had if he wished to pay no heed to
the order of his superior, and to receive the offerings of gold which
the Indians made to him so that he should not oblige them to leave
their recesses, has aided us to his own great credit in collecting the
Indians whom we have today in the two said villages. He made lists of
the people who were in the two villages above mentioned, who amounted
to seven hundred and seventy persons. Those people persevere even yet
in the said two villages, and will persevere so long as the efforts
which are being made to reduce those who are yet intractable in the
mountains, do not cease. The said adjutant and superior commandant of
the said presidio also formed the new village of Alalam by withdrawing
its ancient inhabitants from the places where they lived before, and
brought them within a musket-shot of their fields. They were before
that one legua distant from their fields. That site has a small bay,
which the sea forms there, where there is very good fishing, and where
boats can safely enter. The said village did not have such a bay
before, in the former site. He also made lists of the Indians whom he
brought to the said village, who are the ones of Nalso <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span>who
were located at the foot of the mountains of Buquil, and those who
descended said mountains. I was not present when the said lists were
made and hence do not know the number of the persons there, but it is
evident to me that those gathered in the said village number more than
fifty families. I have seen their houses which are already finished,
and are excellent buildings, made of strong and hard materials. Those
Indians also will retain in the said village, which is large, the
horror which they have for the Spanish arms, and more, if the raids of
the Spaniards on the Indians who still keep to the mountains are
repeated.</p>

<h3 class="main"><i>Of the idolatries of all those Indians</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Having to treat of the idolatries, superstitions,
and customs of the Zambals, I think I ought first to mention that my
purpose is not to discourage the ministers of the gospel, who have to
plant our holy Catholic faith among those Indians, but to impart to
them the brief information which I possess of the little which I have
ascertained in respect to the great amount which there is to ascertain,
and which will be discovered with the lapse of time, concerning the
customs of that blind people, who have lived so misguidedly and so far
from reason at the doors of the true evangelical light which we
profess. Although they are surrounded by provinces whose inhabitants
are excellent Christians, such as the provinces of Pampanga,
Pangasinan, and Mariueles, yet notwithstanding they have been
influenced very little or not at all for the good by the customs of the
Christians, on account of their lack of communication with them; for
they only go to the said provinces to trade <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name="pb299">299</a>]</span>and
traffic for a brief space of time, and then, if anybody is careless
they cut off his head. Hence, as I have said, they have but little
communication with reasonable people. On the contrary, I think this
paper of mine will serve as a stimulus for us religious, who, leaving
our convents of our fatherland Espa&ntilde;a and our friends and
relatives, being moved by the zeal for souls, come to these Philipinas
Islands to publish our holy Catholic faith, to preserve it, and teach
good morals. All this drags us from our provinces in Espa&ntilde;a, and
deprives us of our fatherland. Here, then, among these miserable
Zambals, we shall find much to do. It is unnecessary to go to seek
infidels in other kingdoms, for we have them here, although few; and at
the same time we have one to subject them for us and place them under
our obedience. I say then that this paper of mine will serve as a
stimulus to the ministers of the gospel to come to employ themselves in
the service of our Lord and His holy Catholic faith, when they consider
the great evil that there is to tear out and eradicate from the hearts
of these Indians, and the great good that they lack to make them
Christians. And although there are very many baptized persons among
them, yet in nothing at all are any of them different from the others,
if one considers their customs and mode of living. Those baptized are
as idolatrous as those not baptized. I am not surprised at this, for
until now the former ministers have not had any opportunity for living
in residence among them, since they have not cared to collect them into
a settlement. And if they have collected them, it has been for a short
time only, and their evil customs have taken them again to the
mountains and recesses <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href=
"#pb300" name="pb300">300</a>]</span>whence we have drawn them, but
today according to the efficacy which the governor of these Philipinas
Islands places in the spiritual and temporal good of these wretched
creatures, we have excellent hopes that they will persevere in their
settlements and will be able to be taught the true pathway to
heaven.</p>
<p class="par">These Indians have their priests and priestesses,
although such have no jurisdiction over the others; for here everyone
is master of his own will, and they alone recognize superiority in one
in so far as he gives authority to the other priests and priestesses
for some special sacrifices. This last is done to the one who pays well
for it. This priest is called <i>bayoc</i>, and he dresses like a
woman. He wears a <i>tapis</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e7867src"
href="#xd24e7867" name="xd24e7867src">4</a> or apron, and ties up his
hair like a woman, although above the tapis he wears and girds his
catan, on the left side, and on the right side, his <i>yua</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7877src" href="#xd24e7877" name="xd24e7877src">5</a>
as other men. Those are the weapons of all these Indians and no one
goes without them, even though it be within his own house. The idol to
whom this bayoc principally offers sacrifice is called <i>Malyari</i>,
which means &ldquo;powerful.&rdquo; This idol is made with a wooden
head and its body and hands of straw. They dress it up like an image
after their manner, place it on its altar and niche, then light for it
torches of pitch for lack of wax candles. All the people of the
rancher&iacute;a assemble to make the sacrifice. Having built his
altar, the bayoc takes his spear in his hand and makes three holes in
the earth with it. Those holes are filled with wine, and the spear,
having been thrust into the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href=
"#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>ground, the bayoc begins his
sacrifice, with a leaf of wild <i>anahao</i> or wild palm in his hand.
He commences to shiver, his whole body trembling, and making many wry
faces by means of his eyes, he generally talks, sometimes between his
teeth, without anyone understanding him. Sometimes he contents himself
with the wry faces which he makes with his eyes and the tremblings of
all his body. After a few minutes he strikes himself twice on the knee
with the hand in which he holds the palm-leaf, and says that he is the
anito to whom the sacrifice is being made. At this the sacristan (for
the devil has even in this the semblance of God and wishes to resemble
His Divine Majesty) explains the need of the person who orders the
sacrifice made. The bayoc promises to fulfil the desire of the person
who is having the sacrifice made, and immediately the bystanders begin
to sing certain songs in praise of the anito or idol. While they are
being sung, they give the bayoc and the sacristan something to drink,
and after those two, all those present drink. But no one drinks or eats
anything that has been offered in the sacrifice until the bayoc eats or
drinks, for they say they would die if they ate or drank before the
anito, and for the anito to eat or drink is no other thing than for the
bayoc to eat or drink.</p>
<p class="par">The office of sacristan, although the bayoc gives it to
whomever he wishes, is not of great estimation, and in the absence of
the one appointed for such office, the bayoc substitutes in his place
the first one he lays his eyes on. But the office of bayoc is held in
high estimation among them, and I am not surprised, for it possesses
such advantages that for certain honors which he performs for a
deceased person, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302"
name="pb302">302</a>]</span>they generally give him ten taes in gold.
Those honors are performed so that the soul of the deceased may leave
its relatives, for they say that the said soul always follows them
until said honors are shown it.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7898src"
href="#xd24e7898" name="xd24e7898src">6</a> Those honors are not shown
to all, because all people do not have the means for those expenses.
When they are performed, all the relatives and friends of the deceased
are invited to be present at them. They offer food made of rice, buyo,
tobacco, and wine to the amount that seems sufficient for the guests.
Then clothing <i>Malyari</i> as abovesaid, and presiding over the
ceremonies in a two-fold manner,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7907src"
href="#xd24e7907" name="xd24e7907src">7</a> there is pure disorder.
Some lament, some sing, some play their musical instruments, and some
dance after their manner. But whatever those who lament and those who
sing, lament and sing is in memory of the deceased. Finally, what is
offered is consumed, and when they finish eating and drinking, the
sacrifice is finished, and each of the guests takes his cup from which
he has drunk, although some are accustomed to leave them, but they are
the fewest. Consequently, if one hundred persons attended the honors
one hundred <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span>other cups would have to be obtained for each
person to take his cup. It is to be noticed that they do not always
dress the anito Malyari, for only the bayoc has it, but whenever said
bayoc offers sacrifices for any deceased person he dresses it, although
some sacrifices are also made to other anitos without dressing said
Malyari.</p>
<p class="par">They also have their kind of baptism, which only the
bayoc has authority to administer, first making a sacrifice to Malyari
in the abovesaid manner. At the same time, they clothe the one baptized
according to their fashion. He looses his hair and hangs at the ends
some small pieces of gold. The sacrifice having been finished, in place
of water the bayoc baptizes him with the blood of a hog, either of the
domestic or wild variety. The relatives of the one baptized stand all
about him and the former on top of a rock. The ceremonies having been
finished, the bayoc cuts the ends of the hair of the baptized person,
from which hang the bits of gold, and flings them aloft, and the
bystanders collect them hurriedly. That gold is afterward held in high
estimation and with difficulty will they let go of it. Consequently,
those nearest the one baptized and his relatives, while the ceremonies
and the sacrifice are being performed, sing certain songs, and all
those who are present answer them. However, there are also very few who
are baptized in this manner, because the fees which are given to the
bayoc are large, and generally amount to eight taes of gold. If while
the sacrifice or the ceremony of baptism is being performed, the
bystanders make a great racket, and if after the bayoc has ordered them
to keep still, the noise does not abate, then the bayoc takes some
bran, dust, or sand, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304"
name="pb304">304</a>]</span>and flings it into the air over the heads
of those who are making the racket, and after that is done no one dares
to open his mouth and all the racket stops.</p>
<p class="par">The method exercised by the bayoc in delegating power to
the other priests of the idols is not less ridiculous than all his
other affairs. The new <i>anitero</i> or priest-to-be collects much
wine, and the bayoc attends for one or two days a great drunken revel
which must last for the space of seven days without cessation. In that
revel everyone who enters or goes out, has leave to drink, and they are
so long-winded in that matter that as many as gather there have to get
drunk, and until he falls down and becomes dead drunk, they do not
allow him to leave that place. Then the bayoc thereupon proclaims such
and such a miserable wretch as master of such and such an anito. As
soon as the seven continuous days of the first revel are finished, they
begin another seven days counting every second day; and when those
second seven days are ended, they begin another seven, counting every
third day. If any of these circumstances are lacking, the bayoc says
that the idol or anito will punish them, and such anito will not obey
the priest. The pay which is given to the bayoc for his assistance and
proclamation to the new priest of his priesthood is according to the
anito which he takes; for the anitos have their hierarchies among
themselves. There is one anito which costs eight taes of gold, some
that cost six, some four, and some three, according to the anito which
each one wishes.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Acasi.</i> The anito superior to all seems to me to
be the one called Acasi; for they sing him a song which says
&ldquo;<i lang="tl">Mag yaman man a Malyari monagon si
Acasi</i>,&rdquo; namely, &ldquo;Although Malyari is powerful Acasi
gets the first fruits.&rdquo; This is the refrain when they sing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=
"pb305">305</a>]</span>in the sacrifice which is made to this idol.
That idol has few priests, for the authority given them by the bayoc to
be able to offer sacrifice to him costs them a great sum. That idol,
they say, is useful for the sick, and for works of importance. All his
priests declare that they talk with Acasi, but no one says that he sees
him or does anyone of the bystanders hear him talk. The same is true of
the other idols and their priests; and all become good and drunk
whenever a sacrifice is made, and the priest tells them that the idol
has told him the lies that he makes up, and the others believe them as
truth. This is universal among all the other sacrifices which are made
to the other idols.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Manglobar.</i> There is another idol called
Manglobar. They say that that idol pacifies angry hearts. Hence, when
anyone commits a murder, he sends to the priest of that idol to have
him pacify the relatives of the murdered man, and to reconcile them
with the murderer. That reconciliation consists in the murderer giving
gold or something worth it to the relatives of the murdered person,
according to the rank of the latter. If the murderer has no gold, then
he gives a slave, who is generally some Negrillo of the mountain, whom
they capture for that purpose. And if he cannot do that the priest
kills a son of the murderer or a very near relative. If the murderer
cannot do any of the above things, they kill him. The party offended
also generally has recourse to such priest in order that the offender
may be reconciled with the offended, and that is very general when the
offender is more powerful than the party offended or has more kindred
to protect him. Only a priest is able to uncover that idol.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Mangalagar.</i> There is another idol called
Mangalagar. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>Of that idol it is said that he accompanies the
priest wherever he goes on all occasions when they invoke him (good
guardian angel!) when they have to make any <i>garro</i> or
<i>mangao</i>, which means to cut off some head. If they have made a
catch, they give thanks to such idol, and make him a sacrifice. This is
so closely followed that they will under no circumstances mount into
their house without first offering some sacrifice to such idol; for
they say that they will be punished by that Mangalagar, if they do not
make him a feast before entering their houses, and they will have no
luck another time in cutting off any other head. All those feasts are
made with wine and drunken reveling. That idol has many priests, but
not so many as do the anitos whom they have for their paddy fields.</p>
<p class="par">Of the anitos which they have for their rice, I have not
been able to discover more than five, as follows:</p>
<p class="par"><i>Aniton Tauo.</i> He seems to me to be lord of the
winds, and superior to his four associates whom I shall immediately
name. They offer the <i>pinicpig</i>, which are the firstfruits of
their rice to that one. They gather the green rice and pound it, and
afterwards parch it in a jar or kettle and offer it to him, first
making their bit of an altar where they hang some handfuls of rice in
proportion to the devotion of each one. They call that method of
offering <i>mamiarag</i>. Then follows <i>Dumagan</i>, who they say
causes the rice to head well; then <i>Calasacas</i>, who makes it
ripen; then <i>Calasocos</i>, who they say dries it. Accordingly, they
sacrifice to him so that he may not dry it up. Then follows
<i>Damolag</i>, who they say keeps it from the hurricanes when it is in
flower. Those anitos or idols have very many priests and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name=
"pb307">307</a>]</span>priestesses, although, as I have said, no one
sees the said idols or talks with them. They do not even paint them or
have their images; but what the priest or priestess says to them they
consider as an oracle and say that it will not fail. Every class of
people have recourse to those sacrifices; although some Indians do not
believe in it at all, yet, notwithstanding, all attend them, Christians
and heathens, without excepting anyone.</p>

<h3 class="main"><i>Of the superstitions of the Indians</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">I believe that the errors which they possess in
this matter of superstitions are not less than those which I have
mentioned of their idolatry, although I have not investigated it as
thoroughly as the matter of their idolatry. But with the lapse of time,
they will be discovered and ascertained. There is a bird which they
call <i>salacsac</i>. Its beak is red, as are also its feet. Some of
its feathers are green and some blue with black and white spots. That
bird gets its food in the river. If it appears on the right hand of any
one journeying to any place, he returns, for he says that some accident
will happen to him, or some great trouble on the road, or in the place
where he is going, such as being killed, or being shot with arrows, or
something similar. If the said bird appears on his left hand he says
that the same thing will happen to those whom he leaves at home, such
as his children, wife, father, mother, or very near relative, and on
that account he also returns. However, if the bird sings like a man who
is laughing, then he goes on, and says that that bird is favorable to
him. But if the said bird sings or croaks in any other way he returns,
for he says that it announces some very great <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name=
"pb308">308</a>]</span>danger to him. There is another bird smaller
than a gurrion which they call <i>pasimanuquen</i>. They say the same
of this as of the salacsac. They say the same of the
<i>toc&oacute;</i>, so called by the Tag&aacute;log, and <i>chacon</i>
by the Spaniard. If they go to the mountain or near it and any tree
falls, they say the same as of the chacon and of the two birds above
mentioned. If they go on a journey and hear anyone sneeze they also
return, and if they are prepared and about to do anything, they leave
it then if anyone sneezes. If they hear any crow cawing at night, they
say that it announces the death of a very near relative. If any dog
which belongs to them breaks any of its teeth or falls down, they
either kill the dog or give it to some one; for they say that it
announces some death to them. If the dog jumps out of the window when
it wants to leave the house, they also say that it announces the same
thing. If they dream that the clothing that they have is ragged, they
throw it away because they say that they will die. If they dream that
the house falls down on them and burns them, they destroy it, for they
also say they will die. The devil also has attempted to discredit the
holy rosary among them, and when they go hunting they take it off, for
they say that the dogs will bite the deer or wild boar if they wear a
rosary. Not one of these Indians eats if he is alone, because they say
that they will die. Consequently, what they do is generally to make
their food ready and carry it until they find a company before whom
they may eat. They have also dedicated some places of the mountain and
bamboos to the anito, and, consequently, they cut nothing there, for
they say that they will die and that the anito will kill them, although
they do not know to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309"
name="pb309">309</a>]</span>what anito it is dedicated, or who
dedicated the said mountain or district to such and such an anito, and
know only an old observance which they have received from their
ancestors. In their marriages they also have their superstitions. After
any marriage has been performed, husband and wife go to the mountain to
seek the <i>salacsac</i> or the pasimanuquen, and if the bird sings
well they return very happy; but if it sings badly they return very
sad. If it sings well they carry along the road a <i>bombon</i> or
pitcher of water, and by means of the said water, which is drunk by all
the bystanders, the two newly-married people will have children. For
the bird to sing well, it must sing on their right hand and in the
manner of the said bird which laughs. To sing ill means nothing else
than to sing on the left hand, so that the bird is somewhat hoarse and
sad. In such case they say that said marriage will have a bad ending,
and that one of the two will die in a short time. If they do not see
the bird, they say that they will have no children.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><i>Of the customs of these Indians</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Although those Indians have their kind of rank,
since some are chiefs, and others not, and there are others who are
descended from slaves, yet notwithstanding that they have no obedience
one for the other. The poor man does not obey the rich, nor does the
chief have any authority over him who is not a chief. Those who are
obeyed (although but little) are the old men, when they assemble as if
in council or meeting of the old men. But, in private no one dares to
order another one, neither the chief him who is not a chief, nor the
rich man the poor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310"
name="pb310">310</a>]</span>man; for here every one is master of his
own will, and each one thinks that he is greater than his neighbor.
Their method of governing is by fear, and accordingly each one tries to
make the others fear him more than any other. In order to accomplish
that each one endeavors to beat the others in committing murders, so
that the others may fear him. They commit those murders by treachery.
In order that the relatives of the murdered man may not slay the
murderer, the latter pays such and such a sum of gold to the kindred of
the murdered person, according to the rank of the deceased. For if such
deceased was a chief or had many kin, his murder costs more and is
redeemed by a greater sum. The lowest price with which a murder is
generally redeemed is five taes of gold. If the murderer has no gold,
he redeems the said murder with silver at the rate of eight pesos per
tae of gold, although gold is valued at ten pesos per tae among those
Indians; for it is very low grade gold, and as I have heard said does
not reach fourteen carats. The little gold that they do possess is much
adulterated with silver, copper, and bronze. But if the said murderer
has no gold or silver with which to redeem the murder that he
committed, he goes to the mountain and deceives some black or steals
him and drags him to his rancher&iacute;a, and delivers him to the
relatives of the murdered man so that they may slay the said black.
There is [no] great difficulty in this for in mountains there they have
many acquaintances among the blacks. Those blacks are not without their
enemies in some rancher&iacute;as of the blacks themselves, where they
go to make the seizure. And since the blacks are very revengeful in
taking vengeance on their enemies, they aid the Zambals to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name=
"pb311">311</a>]</span>capture them. The Zambal gives the black, whose
services he has used for that purpose, some arrows or machetes.</p>
<p class="par">But it must also be noticed that they do not always kill
the black who is thus captured, for sometimes they let him live, and he
is made a perpetual slave. There are many such slaves today, and I even
believe that all the slaves whom they have are of this kind. If the
murderer gives a slave in this way, he redeems the murder that he
committed. Even if he cannot give gold or silver or a slave he kills
one of his sons or delivers him to the relatives of the murdered one so
that they may slay him. They never hesitate to kill that son thus
delivered up, for when he can bear arms he will rebel and return to his
father. If perchance the child of the murderer given for ransom of the
murder which he committed is a daughter, when the said daughter is
married she will go to the house of her father or relatives with her
husband. For among the Zambals the woman is greater than the man, and
the men sometimes obey the women. The latter are very haughty, and when
the husband does not obey his wife, marriages are unmade very easily.
If we reach such straits that the murderer has neither gold, silver,
nor anything of value and cannot get a slave in the mountain, or a
black, which is the same thing for that purpose, and has no son or
daughter, or very near relative, such as some small orphan child, then
in such case his kin themselves help him in ransoming himself, for in
any other event, the relatives of the murdered person would infallibly
kill him.</p>
<p class="par">Accordingly, these Indians esteem it highly to have
kinship, and, although they be very remote <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>relatives, they treat one another as brothers
because of the need which they have one of the other, so that they may
be aided one by the other in such cases. Notwithstanding the said
estimation which they have for their relatives, we see an evil and
perverse custom which they have which is worse than the most
blood-thirsty beasts, namely, that Zambals are not accustomed to have
more than two children, one a male and the other a female.
Consequently, if they already have one male child, they kill all the
sons at birth until a daughter is born. Then after they have had said
daughter scarcely is the woman pregnant when they already arrange to
kill the son or daughter, as soon as it emerges from the womb of the
mother. But if any one begs said son or daughter, even while yet in the
womb of its mother it is given to such person. But the one who has
asked for it must pay its mother all the time that the said mother is
occupied in suckling such boy or girl; and afterward it is considered
as the child of that person at whose account it was reared and kept
alive. However, I know many in this manner who have great love for
their true parents. Since we discovered said custom among them, we had
delivered from death three children, although to the great sorrow of
their parents because they had not killed them. But as soon as we find
out that any woman is pregnant, we warn her that she must not kill the
son or daughter that she brings forth, for we will punish her very
severely, and they, for fear of the punishment, allow their children to
live.</p>
<p class="par">They also have their mourning for very near deceased
relatives. That consists in wearing a cloth on the head, which they are
accustomed to remove in no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href=
"#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>case until they have committed a
murder. And as long as they wear the said mourning which they call
<i>balata</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8031src" href="#xd24e8031"
name="xd24e8031src">8</a> they are not accustomed to sing, or dance, or
play their musical instruments; nor will they attend any feast among
them. Those feasts are always made with wine, and their musical
instruments are played at them. But when they have cut off some head,
or committed some murder, then they remove the balata, or mourning. For
that purpose the relatives assemble and a great drunken revel is made
where much wine is consumed and some days spent in this occupation.
Accordingly, it is necessary that among these Indians many murders must
be committed, for no mourning is removed until some murder has been
committed, and then the relatives of the one who has been recently
murdered in order to remove the previous mourning, also put on new
mourning, and in order to remove that it is necessary to commit another
murder. Hence, they mutually kill one another, and they are always
wearing mourning, except when the murder is committed far away among
the blacks, or among the Indians subject to his Majesty in the
neighboring provinces. And in order that they may not proceed <i lang=
"la">ad infinitum</i> in this manner, they try to commit the murders
which they do commit secretly, when it is not in their district, so
that the said murder may not be attributed to them. But, having
committed the said murder, then they tell it to their neighbors, and
they make merry, sing, and play their music, for as long a time as they
ceased to make merry during the time when they wore the balata.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name=
"pb314">314</a>]</span>Thus it is commonly said that three-fourths of
those who die among these Zambals die violent deaths, and one-fourth
and even not that much, die natural deaths. But whenever there is any
death, be it violent or natural, there is the balata which must be
removed by another death, either by killing another Zambal, a black of
the mountain, or an Indian of the provinces, near the said Zambals, or
a black of the mountain, or an Indian. I know a man who is said to have
committed sixty murders. I do not dare to assert as true that which is
told me of that Indian, but what I know is that those Indians do not
get angry or take it as an affront among themselves to be so cruel, but
on the contrary they highly praise and assert those customs, and are
vain of the murders which they commit. Thus, as among the Spaniards,
one speaks and talks with courtesy of &ldquo;my associate so and
so,&rdquo; &ldquo;my neighbor,&rdquo; &ldquo;my comrade,&rdquo; etc.,
and it is a kind of discourtesy to say &ldquo;Juan Fernandez&rdquo;
&ldquo;Pedro Sanchez,&rdquo; etc.; so also among these Indians it is a
discourtesy to be called by one&rsquo;s companions only men. It is a
high and good politeness to be called by the name which signifies in
their own language, &ldquo;an accomplice in a murder&rdquo; that title
being &ldquo;<i>Araoc</i>;&rdquo; and thus they say Araoc Juan, etc.
And as they are little given to flattery, they never give the name of
Araoc to him who does not really and truly possess it; for it is
regarded among them as making a jest at one to whom the said title is
given, if it does not belong to him, just as among us it is a jest to
give the title of a brave man to one who does not dare to draw his
sword from his belt.</p>
<p class="par">Their marriages are not made between relatives, but on
the contrary they try to marry those who are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span>not
related to them; and I believe that the reason therefor is to acquire
new kinship by means of marriage, for we see that he who has the most
kindred is the most powerful, is the one held in highest esteem by all
and commits more murders in which consists their greatest estate, for
he has more and greater opportunity to go scotfree from those murders
which he commits. Marriages are not performed until the relatives of
both parties are assembled, and order the two contracting parties to
eat together from one plate. All the other preceding preparations and
ceremonies belong to the contract of the marriage and the betrothal.
Said marriages, moreover, are [not] made by virtue of the wish of the
contracting parties, for they are married from childhood when most of
the contracting parties do not even have the use of their reason. The
reason that has been given to me for this is so that they may be raised
together from childhood, and contract love one for the other. But we
see that very many marriages result badly, and after marriage the
parties separate, although in this regard the men are very patient, for
among these Indians, as among all those of this land, it is the custom
for the man to give the dowry to the woman. Among the Zambals, it is
the custom not only to give the dowry to the woman, but also another
kind of dowry to all the relatives of the said woman. They call the
latter dowry <i>sambon</i>. Among the Tag&aacute;logs it was also
formerly the custom and was called <i>sohol</i>. That second dowry
among these Indians is generally larger than the first, which is the
one that is given to the woman. If husband and wife quarrel, and she
wishes to separate from her husband and marry another man, and if the
cause of the quarrel has been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316"
href="#pb316" name="pb316">316</a>]</span>given by the man; they are
divorced and he loses the dowry which he gave to his wife, as well as
that which he gave to the relatives of said wife. But if the cause of
the said quarrel proceeded from the wife and she wishes to be divorced,
she must return all the dowry, and in such case her relatives also
return that which was given to them. And since it is of some
consequence to them whether the two married people live at peace or at
war, it is very common for all the woman&rsquo;s kin to take her side,
in order not to return what was given to each one. Consequently,
although there may never be justice, the woman always has the argument
on her side to do that which she wishes. And since there is no other
justice here than the yua, bows and arrows, the <i>tanca</i>, and
caraza, the greater kindred and those most interested always prevail;
and since these are the relatives of the woman to whom the dowry was
given and the husband is alone, and at the most is supported by his
brothers, always or generally the argument is on the side of the wife,
and the husband has to give up both dowries. Consequently, the poor
Zambal, in order not to be left without wife and dowry, endures
whatever his wife wishes. Besides, these Indians are not so barbarous
that they do not know when they are right in what they ask, and when
they are not right. Consequently, the wife will never say that she
wishes to be divorced unless it is when the husband was the evident
cause of the quarrel. However, sometimes they are accustomed to make
friendship between the husband and wife, on condition that the husband
commit a murder. In such an event he leaves the house and does not come
again into the presence of his wife until he commits said murder. The
murder having been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317"
name="pb317">317</a>]</span>committed, and said wife hearing of it,
before the husband reaches the house, his wife goes to receive him with
a new bajaque in her hands, in order to present it to her husband in
sign of congratulation for obeying her. But in such an event the wife
and her relatives have to make good the damage which follows from the
said murder, and the husband is free. The ceremony of the wife going
out to meet her husband with the present of the bajaque on said
occasion is of so great importance among these Indians that the husband
will be grieved if his wife fails in this ceremony or courtesy.</p>
<p class="par">The married women have one good custom, and that is that
they are chaste and loyal to their husbands. Scarcely can a married
woman be found among the Zambals of whom it can be said casually that
she has had lascivious communication with another, although it is very
common for all the people to sleep together in one hut or thicket, and
all, both men and women, are intoxicated. But there will be no occasion
for a man to jest with a married woman, and more, in the presence of
others. But I also believe that that chastity or less incontinence in
this matter was not taught by the devil for the welfare and honor of
these Zambals, but to give them more opportunities to commit more
murders and to make them more turbulent, for the married men are very
jealous of their wives and in no case do they leave them. Wherever they
go, they go together, and do not lose sight of one another. When they
go on a journey, they take all their possessions and the wife carries
it all in a basket which she bears on her back by means of a cord from
the head. The man with his bow and arrow escorts her. They are
accustomed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span>even to carry the hen and its chicks in the said
basket or under the arm, so that they carry all that they can of the
possessions which they have in their house except what is not portable,
and those they hide in the thicket. And if the husband absents himself
because of any occurrence, and cannot take his wife with him, and if,
during the said absence, the wife weakens in her chastity, and it comes
to be common property in the rancher&iacute;a, for if she has been weak
it is very difficult to keep such news from her husband, for these
Indians cannot keep a secret: then in such an event the husband kills
without any remedy the one who has offended him by sinning with his
wife. And having killed such a person, he informs the relatives
themselves of said wife of the treachery which his wife has committed
in order that they may kill her; and if the said relatives neglect to
kill such a wife, then, in that case her own husband kills her and can
kill also any relative of the said wife without being obliged in that
account to pay anything. Notwithstanding this custom, that quarrel is
generally patched up with gold, but they must have much gold among them
for that means. I know a principal woman, one of the most influential
of said Zambals, whom one of these contentions cost more than thirty
taes of gold and two slaves whom she delivered up so that their heads
might be cut off. But it is to be noted that the offender of the wife,
or the adulterer [<i>mancebo</i>], gives said gold to the husband of
said wife, and the wife gives the gold to her own relatives, if they
are her cousins and brothers. That woman and chieftainess is called
Monica Corosan and was married <i lang="es">in facie eclesia</i>
[<i>i.e.</i>, with the rites of the Church], and because she has been
weak and little <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319"
name="pb319">319</a>]</span>or not at all faithful to her husband, it
cost her the sum above mentioned, and she was divorced and separated
from her legitimate husband, by whom she had a son, and was remarried
to her adulterer. He already has three daughters. But although the said
quarrel was patched up by means of the gold she has not dared to appear
before her relatives for more than twelve years. Consequently, the fact
that said women are so chaste proceeds from this rigor which they
exercise in this matter. If they value their husbands and relatives so
greatly, it is because the latter may take vengeance. I believe that
the single women are also chaste, although some are generally careless;
but both the woman and the accomplice pay with their lives if the fact
is learned. If any woman is pregnant, her relatives force her to tell
who is the accomplice of her pregnancy, and if the two do not marry,
the relatives kill them both without being obliged to give any
compensation therefor.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Burials.</i> In their burials, they are not wont to
shroud the deceased but to clothe him. If he is a chief they put two
dresses on him, according to their manner, and two robes. If the
deceased has any share in any inheritance of gold, before they bury
said deceased, the gold is divided before the corpse itself, and the
part which belonged to him is placed in the grave with the said corpse
with his store of certain articles of food. I have heard it said of the
natives of Buquil that if the deceased is a chief and has any slave,
they kill a slave and bury him with his master. I have had very little
to do with the natives of Buquil, and, consequently, I do not know how
much truth there is in this, and I do not affirm it. I have also heard
another thing said which would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320"
href="#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>horrify the ears were I to
tell it; hence I do not dare to set it down on this paper. For, as I
say, I have had but little to do with the natives of Buquil, as they
have not allowed us to enter there, and if I were to qualify it as true
when I was not sure that it was true, if it afterwards appears to be
false, it will be inferred that there is but little truth in this paper
of mine. Consequently, I will not mention it.</p>
<p class="par">There is a kind of contempt which is very great among
the Indians for one who has not murdered anyone. Consequently, those
who have some little gold with which to pay for their murders are much
given to this vice of murdering. They generally buy slaves or negrillos
of the mountain so that their little sons might kill them. Binding the
wretched slave or black they take said sufferer into the presence of
their sons from three to seven years old and there kill him, and by
that means their minds and all their being become acquainted with the
idea of blood, so that when they are grown they may have so evil a
custom. It is a curious thing that they generally buy many blacks or
slaves for that purpose, and if one cannot do it, or has no wealth for
the purpose of buying a black or slave in order that he may kill him
alone, he unites with others, and thus many together buy said black.
One buys the right to give the first lance-thrust or stab, another the
second, another to take away a quarter of the head, another another bit
of it, another half the head&mdash;according to the amount of the
capital of each one&mdash;and he who wounds him with greater ferocity,
that one has the best lot. I will relate a matter in regard to this,
which happened to me when I was vicar of Abucay. Once I had about five
little Zambal lads in the convent whom I was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name=
"pb321">321</a>]</span>teaching to pray and read. It happened that the
fathers of three of them came to see them, and that gave the children,
who were seven or eight years old, a desire to return to Playa Honda
with their fathers. I gave them permission, for their parents begged it
of me. I did not give permission to the other two, and, consequently,
they remained in said convent with me. While the other little fellows
were returning in company with their fathers and passing by Mariyumo,
which is a visita of Mariueles, it happened that the Indians of that
visita, who are also Zambals and but very little different from those
of Playa Honda, had that day caught a black of the mountain, whom they
were about to kill on the following day. The Zambals and the children,
their sons, stayed for the feast in celebration of the killing of the
black. For their joy in being present at a death of any person in such
a manner is as great as it is for Spaniards to attend a zarza or play
or all to play at ring.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8091src" href=
"#xd24e8091" name="xd24e8091src">9</a> That news came to the ears of
the children, who remained under my care in Abucay, two months
afterwards. They were told of the feast which their three companions
had had in the village of Mariyumo when they were at the killing; and
so great was their sorrow that they had not returned on that past
occasion with their three companions that they began to bewail their
lack of luck because they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href=
"#pb322" name="pb322">322</a>]</span>had not returned with their
companions so that they also might have been present at the killing.
Hence, one can infer their so great inclination for this vice, for
those who have never seen nor known any better customs learn to kill
from early childhood. And in case that anyone has entire information
concerning the peace and quiet into which the Christians come by means
of the Catholic faith, since they have to live among Indians of such
customs, they must always have death in their hands or before their
eyes, for one can trust no one, since they do not trust themselves. For
every step that they take is at the risk of their lives. Often they
kill from necessity, as they believe, so that they may not be killed,
as happens when they see in their rancher&iacute;as any person or
persons whom they do not know. Since they do not know whether such
persons are about to kill them, they anticipate them and take away
their lives, but it is more usual to kill for revenge and to make
oneself feared and famous in this matter. There are many of them who,
when they have committed fifteen murders, place on the hams of the legs
certain strings of a small white fruit of an herb which they call
<i>bantacan</i>. When they have killed seventeen persons, they place
the said fruit very close together in the manner of a rosary which they
call <i>tigdin</i>. When the number has reached more than nineteen,
they take away said fruit and in its place wear certain very highly
colored sigueyes. But it is to be noted that, although twenty men take
part in one murder, in order that they may wear that regalia, which
they consider as <i>tabi</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8112src" href=
"#xd24e8112" name="xd24e8112src">10</a> each one claims said murder as
his, as if he had done it alone. They also generally tie a long
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name=
"pb323">323</a>]</span>narrow strip of <i>anahao</i>, or palmleaf, on
the hilt of their dagger or yua. That token shows that he who carries
it was the first one to strike the person that was killed on that
occasion. Notwithstanding the abovesaid, if anyone goes to their
rancher&iacute;as in company with another Zambal of their number, he is
sufficiently safe although he might be still safer at Manila.</p>

<h3 class="main"><i>Of the change which we see today in these
Indians</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">He who considers their barbarous customs,
idolatries, superstitions, and the natural and great inclination for
killing which these Indians possess, and in which they have been
reared; and hears of the so great change and the difference which
exists at present in all their customs, when compared to those that
they possessed in their recesses and rancher&iacute;as: will easily
understand that already God is walking among them, and that He has
already taken pity on the souls and wishes them for <span class="corr"
id="xd24e8126" title="Source: himself">Himself</span>. The immortality
of the soul has already been explained to these Indians in their mother
tongue; as has also the reward which God has for those who keep His
commandments and those of our holy mother Church, and the punishment
reserved for those who break them, and that, for as many sins as man
commits he has to take his punishment in this life or in the next; and
the unity of God, His eternity, and at the same time that which the
Christian man must believe in order to be saved.</p>
<p class="par">It has been father Fray Domingo Escalera who has already
learned their language, and has gone communicating it from one to the
other, until there are now very few who do not understand this. When
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=
"pb324">324</a>]</span>said father explains to them something of which
they have not heard, all look at one another, as if surprised to hear
what they are hearing. I have not had the capacity to do as much as the
said father, but I have managed to explain it also in the
Tag&aacute;log tongue to those who understand it. But they do not
understand many things, and I cannot tell them to them. Consequently, I
trust, God helping, that said father will produce great fruit among
these Indians, as he has learned their language. These Indians did not
observe any festivals or Sunday, or Lent, or vigil, or Friday.
Consequently, although there are many Christians baptized from
childhood, it was the same as if they were heathen, and there was no
difference between heathens and Christians. Having explained to them on
one occasion the seriousness of the sin of breaking feast days, one of
them went to the mountain and one Sunday while cutting some bamboos he
hurt his foot. The rumor spread among the Indians that God had punished
that Indian because he worked on Sunday, and from that time they have
observed feast days and Sundays. On another occasion, namely, Ash
Wednesday, the said father told them that they ought to abstain from
eating meat throughout Lent, and that God would punish whoever broke
said precept. Next day an Indian went hunting, and having killed a
carabao calf, while he was cutting it up and carrying it to his house
or to the village, the mother of the calf came out of the thicket and
killed the Indian. Thereupon, the father took occasion to again charge
them to abstain from meat during Lent, Friday, and vigil. All through
Lent there was scarcely one Christian or heathen who dared to eat meat.
For about eight months we lived in a small house which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span>had
scarcely room for the two beds of two religious. We had three Indians
of Abucay who built us another larger house where we could live with
some freedom. There was no Indian who would be so kind as to aid them
in their customs in anything, until they saw that the presidio of the
Spaniards which is located twelve leguas from the village where we
united these Indians, had already about forty men, and as soon as they
heard the arquebuses in Buquil, which was ten leguas from the said
village, they moved quickly, and no longer answered a dry &ldquo;no
quiero&rdquo; [<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;I will not&rdquo;], for whatever we
commanded them, as they had before answered us all the time. I have
already said above that the devil had discredited the rosary of the
most holy Virgin, our Lady, among these Indians, and although some had
rosaries which some faithful ones or religious had given them, in order
to incline them to that holy devotion, yet no one of them could recite
it, for there was no one who knew anything of the prayer. They only
kept it in order to show it to those who went to trade and traffic at
their rancher&iacute;as, in order that they might consider them as
Christians, as it is a kind of affront among them not to be a
Christian. On the contrary they believed that nothing good would happen
to them if they wore the rosary about their necks. But seeing the
esteem which we had for those sacred beads, and that in their
sicknesses when they asked us for any remedy for their attacks in which
we do not apply any other medicine except the sacred rosary, and when
they recognize that they recover miraculously from their illness by the
use of the rosary alone, they believe that the devil had deceived them,
and are growing very fond of this holy devotion, so <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name="pb326">326</a>]</span>that
now very many of the married men, the single youth, indeed, the old
men, wear the rosary about their necks, some recite it in their houses,
and others attend church morning and afternoon to recite the rosary
with the lads, and very many of them already know the whole prayer, and
recite it at night in their houses in a loud voice. They formerly
obeyed no one, but now they show great respect to their
gobernadorcillos, to their chief, and to the old men, so that, if they
are seated anywhere and their gobernadorcillo arrives, they all rise,
and no one sits or covers his head until his gobernadorcillo is seated.
Father Domingo Escalera has lived for a short time with the Indians of
Nuebo Toledo, since they were gathered together. Having come to the
said village during the last days of the past Lenten season, and seeing
the so great change that God had produced in them, he said: &ldquo;At
the rate with which God is changing the hearts of these Indians, they
will be better Christians than those of Masinloc before ten
years&rsquo; time, although said Indians of Masinloc have been
Christians for more than sixty years.&rdquo; When we reached their
districts in the beginning, the children and even the women fled from
us, but today the women are very affable and those who have anything to
wear go to church and scarcely can we keep the children away from us.
When we go to the village, they come down from their houses and
accompany us, and we can scarcely walk, because they seize us by our
habits, and place their scapularies before our eyes. Every morning and
afternoon they go to the church to pray and to hear mass. Before mass
we recite the rosary, and after mass the whole prayer. In the afternoon
we leave the church in the manner of a procession in two choirs, and
the father sings the prayer and they <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb327" href="#pb327" name="pb327">327</a>]</span>answer until the
prayer is finished. And on entering the church again candles are
lighted to our Lady, and the holy rosary is also recited.</p>

<h3 class="main"><i>Method used in getting these Indians to persevere
in said prayers</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Zambals are the most cowardly people in these
islands, although they have hitherto been considered by the neighboring
provinces as a people of great courage and warlike. Their cowardice
could be proved by many examples, but that does not concern the present
matter. Their whole strength consists in fleeing, and their courage in
hiding. From that cowardice it proceeds that all the murders that they
commit are by treachery. It never happens that if, fighting face to
face, the enemy escapes and is on his guard and watchful, they commit
any murder, because of their great timidity and cowardice. Accordingly,
in order that those whom we have assembled in the three villages above
mentioned, may persevere in their settlements, the most efficacious
fear and the one most suited to their nature is that the Spaniards of
the fort and presidio of Paynauen of whom they have a very great fear,
may come very often to the said villages and overrun the land, and
penetrate even into their old recesses where they formerly lived; and
if perchance they should find anything planted in the said recesses
that they would destroy it and cut it down without leaving them
anything. And so that they may see that the father protects them, when
the said Spaniards come to the village, the father opposes them and
takes the part of the Indians.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8148src"
href="#xd24e8148" name="xd24e8148src">11</a> But it is always necessary
in this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>matter for the soldiers to conquer, and the
father is always very careful to always inform the Spaniards by whom
and where anything is planted which it may be necessary to destroy, and
that the edicts which his Lordship, the governor, sent them be carried
out. These are to the effect that no one should plant anything in the
old rancher&iacute;as and that in the village each one should plant one
thousand feet of gabes, and five hundred of sugar-cane; that said
soldiers are to continue to make raids through the whole plain as I
say, very often; yet, whenever the soldiers come to the village, they
are to ask the gobernadorcillo and cabezas (for whom already they have
some obedience) for permission to go to look for those who have become
fugitives, and the father is to go along in order to assure such
fugitive. As said absence has proceeded a trifle from fear of the
Spaniard, the Indians of the village themselves are to go to seek those
who should have become fugitives, in order that they may not go in
company with the Spaniard to the mountain, for the fear which they have
of the said soldiers is inexplicable. They are to oblige said Indians
to make their gardens and fields in the village, where they have fine
lands, very fertile for fields and gardens. If any are found to be
neglectful in this, such persons are to be bound in order to keep them
and take them to the fort so that they may pound rice for the soldiers.
By those measures, there is no man who dares to return to the mountain.
After they have lost their fear of the Spaniards, the latter are to try
to excite trouble between the Indians and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name=
"pb329">329</a>]</span>blacks of the mountain,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8157src" href="#xd24e8157" name="xd24e8157src">12</a> but at all
events said Spaniards are to make no trouble for the Indians whom they
find in the villages, but rather must treat them well.</p>
<p class="par">In order that this may have effect, it is necessary for
the governor to send twenty or thirty horses to the said district, so
that the Spaniards may get over the country, for the roads are
intolerable, especially from the fort to Santa Rossa de Banguen. That
is a distance of six leguas of very troublesome sandy ground without a
drop of fresh water in the dry season. There is a distance of six
leguas also from Santa Rossa de Banguen to Nuevo Toledo, where one
cannot find a tree under which to rest. Accordingly, without the said
horses, nothing can be done, for all those who should go to the said
places run great risk from the sun, as happened when Adjutant Alvaro
Martin Franco went to the said villages to hold the elections, when
almost all the Spaniards who accompanied him fell sick. Said horses
will be of great use to the soldiers in hunting, for this country has
abundance of game. With the horses also they can overrun the land of
Buquil, and terrorize intractable persons. Since said Spaniards often
go to and fro between these villages and to Buquil, no Indian will go
to the mountain, since no harm is done to them in the village; and
those of the mountain considering their restlessness and that they are
not safe and that the Spaniards destroy their fields will descend to
sow and to live in the settlement. For today, if those of the mountain
do not descend, it is because they fear <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb330" href="#pb330" name="pb330">330</a>]</span>that the Spaniards
will punish them for not having descended before.</p>
<p class="par">In order to suppress all their bad customs, after having
preached against them, proving them with natural arguments which are
very easy and clear, with some examples which cause them horror, the
most efficacious means which I find is for the father to investigate
all their customs, and to understand them thoroughly, so that he may
know them all; and then to make fun of the Indians because they do not
know that that is bad. If this is not sufficient, it is efficacious for
the father to make them afraid that he is going to retire because they
refuse to learn good customs, and abandon their abuses and atrocities,
so that in such an event the Spaniards may come upon them and kill them
all; and by means of the fear which they have the father can do
whatever he wishes with them.</p>
<p class="par">I assert that I have investigated thoroughly whatever I
have written in this paper by the aid of some Christian Zambals who are
very good Catholics whom I have had under my care for four years, and
whom I have been teaching to read and have instructed in our holy
Catholic faith by means of the Tag&aacute;log books which have been
written for that purpose by the zealous ministers whom that
Tag&aacute;log nation has had. One of these Zambals is the son of a
priest of the idols, who was reared in a rancher&iacute;a where
sacrifices were often made to the idols. An uncle of this lad whom I
also have under my charge was formerly bayoc of the Zambals, so that he
knows all the ceremonies, superstitions, and sacrifices, and is also
thoroughly conversant with their customs, for he lived among the said
Zambals for about twenty years. Besides this, for three years I have
had with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>me another child about ten years old who also
knows the customs of these Indians, because he was born and raised
among them, for he is the son of Zambal parents. All of those persons
tell me what passes among the said Zambals. Besides this, I have also
managed to prove it from the children of the village who, since they do
not realize my purpose in questioning them in regard to these things,
tell me it all. But if I ask any of the old men, or anyone who is very
maliciously minded, he will not tell me anything unless I ask him
secretly.</p>
<p class="par">Consequently, I consider as true whatever I have written
here, and I have refused to write anything of which I am doubtful.</p>

<p class="par">[Below is added by another person:]</p>
<p class="par">Until the year 1682, said Zambals were reduced and
softened by the vigilance and attendance of the father missionaries of
the order of our father St. Dominic. May our Lord prosper everything as
He is able.</p>
<p class="par">Afterward in November, of the year 83, a bold Indian
with another who accompanied him, waited in a concealed thicket for the
father-vicar, Fray Domingo Perez, who was journeying from one village
to another, and shot him with an arrow, so that he reached his village
badly wounded and died in a short time, after confessing to father Fray
Juan Rois. Since that time the Zambals have been in revolt. May it be
the Lord&rsquo;s will that they grow quiet. Now since the assembly of
84 the fathers have been living cautiously and near the fortress. The

(<i><a class="pglink xd24e48" title="Link to Project Gutenberg ebook"
href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20329">Negritos of
Zambales</a></i>) says, (p. 27): &ldquo;Everything in the history of
the Zambal people and their present comparative unimportance goes to
show that they were the most indolent and backward of the Malayan
peoples. While they have never given the governing powers much trouble,
yet they have not kept pace with the agricultural and commercial
progress of the other people, and their territory has been so steadily
encroached on from all sides by their more aggressive neighbors that
their separate identity is seriously threatened. The rich valleys of
Zambales have long attracted Ilokano immigrants, who have founded
several important towns. The Zambals themselves, owing to lack of
communication between their towns, have developed their separate
dialects.... [but] Zambal as a distinct dialect is gradually
disappearing.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Zambals, however, lived in so close
contact with the Negritos that they impressed their language on them so
thoroughly, that no trace of the dialect of the latter people remains
in Zambales&rdquo; (p. 28).</p>
<p class="par footnote cont">As pointed out in a recent communication
from James A. LeRoy, the Zambals were mountaineers, kin to the Igorot
of today, and of Malay origin. They probably formed a portion of a very
early migratory movement from the south who were pushed back into the
hills. They must not be confused with the Negritos, who are not
Malayan. The Malayan origin of the Zambals can be easily seen from

&aacute; la sortija</i>. This is an equestrian sport, which is played
by taking an iron ring as large as a Segovian ochavo (a small brass
coin). This ring is fitted into another piece of iron, from which it
can be easily withdrawn. The latter is hung from a cord or pole a few
feet from the ground, and the horsemen and others who take part in the
game, taking the proper distance, go toward the ring at a run. The one
who bears off the ring on his lance is declared the winner. See

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
